# Plots

## Introduction

The [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function is the most frequently used function used to display information calculated using Pine scripts. It is versatile and can plot different styles of lines, histograms, areas, columns (like volume columns), fills, circles or crosses.

The use of [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) to create fills is explained in the page on [Fills](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/fills/).

This script showcases a few different uses of [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) in an overlay script:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-Introduction-01.Cylrqa-m_E2dID.webp)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`plot()`", "", true)
plot(high, "Dashed blue `high` line", linestyle = plot.linestyle_dashed)
plot(math.avg(close, open), "Crosses in body center", close > open ? color.lime : color.purple, 6, plot.style_cross)
plot(math.min(open, close), "Navy step line on body low point", color.navy, 3, plot.style_stepline)
plot(low, "Gray dot on `low`", color.gray, 3, plot.style_circles)

color VIOLET = #AA00FF
color GOLD   = #CCCC00
ma = ta.alma(hl2, 40, 0.85, 6)
var almaColor = color.silver
almaColor := ma > ma[2] ? GOLD : ma < ma[2]  ? VIOLET : almaColor
plot(ma, "Two-color ALMA", almaColor, 2)
```

Note that:

-   The first [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call plots a blue line across the bar highs with a dashed line style. The line uses the default width of 1 pixel.
-   The second call plots crosses at the mid-point of candle bodies. The crosses are colored lime for up bars and purple for down bars. The argument `6` used for `linewidth` is a relative size, not a pixel value.
-   The third call plots a 3-pixel-wide step line following the lowest point of candle bodies.
-   The fourth call plots a gray circle at the bars’ [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low).
-   The last plot requires some preparation. We first define our bull/bear colors, calculate an [Arnaud Legoux Moving Average](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000594683), then make our color calculations. We initialize our color variable on bar zero only, using [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var). We initialize it to [color.silver](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color.silver), so on the dataset’s first bars, until the line is higher/lower than its value two bars ago, it is silver. Looking two bars back creates smoother color transitions than one bar back.

The next script shows other uses of [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) in a separate pane:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-Introduction-02.CEeiodqC_Z1WHdqJ.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Volume change", format = format.volume)

color GREEN         = #008000
color GREEN_LIGHT   = color.new(GREEN, 50)
color GREEN_LIGHTER = color.new(GREEN, 85)
color PINK          = #FF0080
color PINK_LIGHT    = color.new(PINK, 50)
color PINK_LIGHTER  = color.new(PINK, 90)

bool  barUp = ta.rising(close, 1)
bool  barDn = ta.falling(close, 1)
float volumeChange = ta.change(volume)

volumeColor = barUp ? GREEN_LIGHTER : barDn ? PINK_LIGHTER : color.gray
plot(volume, "Volume columns", volumeColor, style = plot.style_columns)

volumeChangeColor = barUp ? volumeChange > 0 ? GREEN : GREEN_LIGHT : volumeChange > 0 ? PINK : PINK_LIGHT
plot(volumeChange, "Volume change columns", volumeChangeColor, 12, plot.style_histogram)

plot(0, "Zero line", color.gray)
```

Note that:

-   We are plotting normal [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) values as wide columns above the zero line (see the `style = plot.style_columns` in our [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call).
-   Before plotting the columns we calculate our `volumeColor` by using the values of the `barUp` and `barDn` boolean variables. They become respectively `true` when the current bar’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) is higher/lower than the previous one. Note that the “Volume” built-in does not use the same condition; it identifies an up bar with `close > open`. We use the `GREEN_LIGHTER` and `PINK_LIGHTER` colors for the volume columns.
-   Because the first [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call plots *columns*, we do not use the `linewidth` parameter, as it has no effect on columns.
-   Our script’s second plot is the **change** in volume, which we calculate using `ta.change(volume)`. This value is plotted as a *histogram*, for which the `linewidth` parameter controls the width of the column. We make this width `12` so that histogram elements are thinner than the columns of the first plot. Positive/negative `volumeChange` values plot above/below the zero line; no manipulation is required to achieve this effect.
-   Before plotting the histogram of `volumeChange` values, we calculate its color value, which can be one of four different colors. We use the bright `GREEN` or `PINK` colors when the bar is up/down *and* the volume has increased since the last bar (`volumeChange > 0`). Because `volumeChange` is positive in this case, the histogram’s element is plotted above the zero line. We use the bright `GREEN_LIGHT` or `PINK_LIGHT` colors when the bar is up/down *and* the volume has **not** increased since the last bar. Because `volumeChange` is negative in this case, the histogram’s element is plotted below the zero line.
-   Finally, we plot a zero line. As an alternative, using `hline(0)` achieves the same effect.
-   We use `format = format.volume` in our [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) call so that large values displayed for this script are abbreviated like those of the built-in “Volume” indicator.

A [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call must always be in the script’s *global* scope, i.e., at the *beginning* of a non-indented line. Scripts cannot call the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function from the indented (local) blocks of [user-defined functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/) or conditional structures like [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) blocks, [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops, etc. Calls to [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) **can**, however, be designed to plot conditionally in two ways, which we cover in the [Plotting conditionally](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/plots/#plotting-conditionally) section of this page.

If the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call includes `force_overlay = true`, the result always displays on the main chart pane, even if the script is running in a separate pane. Otherwise, the script displays the plot in the same pane in which it runs. By contrast, scripts can only [color bars](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/bar-coloring/) in the main chart pane, regardless of where they run.

## ​plot()​ parameters

The [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function has the following signature:

```
plot(series, title, color, linewidth, style, trackprice, histbase, offset, join, editable, show_last, display, format, precision, force_overlay, linestyle) → plot
```

The parameters of [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) are:

`series`

It is the only mandatory parameter. Its argument must be of “series int/float” type. Note that because the [auto-casting](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#type-casting) rules in Pine Script® convert in the “int” 🠆 “float” 🠆 “bool” direction, a “bool” type variable cannot be used as is for the `series`; it must be converted to an equivalent “int” or “float” type argument. For example, to plot a series based on a “bool” variable `newDay`, we can pass `newDay ? 1 : 0` as the `series` argument to plot 1 when the variable is `true` and 0 when it is `false`.

`title`

Requires a “const string” argument, so it must be known at compile time. The string appears:

-   In the script’s scale when the “Chart settings/Scales/Indicator Name Label” field is checked.
-   In the Data Window.
-   In the “Settings/Style” tab.
-   In the dropdown of [input.source()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.source) fields.
-   In the “Condition” field of the “Create Alert” dialog box, when the script is selected.
-   As the column header when exporting chart data to a CSV file.

`color`

Accepts “series color”, so can be calculated on the fly, bar by bar. Plotting with [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) as the color, or any color with a transparency of 100, is one way to hide plots when they are not needed.

`linewidth`

Is the plotted element’s size, but it does not apply to all styles. When a line is plotted, the unit is pixels. It has no impact when [plot.style\_columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_columns) is used.

`style`

The available arguments are:

-   [plot.style\_line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_line) (the default): It plots a continous line using the `linewidth` argument in pixels for its width. It does not plot any [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values, but does draw a line through them by joining the most recent non-[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value to the next non-[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value. comes in.
-   [plot.style\_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_linebr): Allows the plotting of discontinuous lines by not plotting on [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values, and not joining such gaps.
-   [plot.style\_stepline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_stepline): Plots using a staircase effect. Transitions between changes in values are done using a vertical line drawn in middle of bars, as opposed to a point-to-point diagonal joining the midpoints of bars. Can also be used to achieve an effect similar to that of [plot.style\_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_linebr), but only if care is taken to plot no color on [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values.
-   [plot.style\_area](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_area): Plots a line of `linewidth` width, filling the area between the line and the `histbase`. The `color` argument is used for both the line and the fill. You can make the line a different color by using another [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it.
-   [plot.style\_areabr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_areabr): This is similar to [plot.style\_area](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_area) but it doesn’t bridge over [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values. Another difference is how the indicator’s scale is calculated. Only the plotted values serve in the calculation of the *y* range of the script’s visual space. If only high values situated far away from the `histbase` are plotted, for example, those values will be used to calculate the *y* scale of the script’s visual space. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it.
-   [plot.style\_columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_columns): Plots columns similar to those of the “Volume” built-in indicator. The `linewidth` value does **not** affect the width of the columns. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it. Always includes the value of `histbase` in the *y* scale of the script’s visual space.
-   [plot.style\_histogram](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_histogram): Plots columns similar to those of the “Volume” built-in indicator, except that the `linewidth` value is used to determine the width of the histogram’s bars in pixels. Note that since `linewidth` requires an “input int” value, the width of the histogram’s bars cannot vary bar to bar. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it. Always includes the value of `histbase` in the *y* scale of the script’s visual space.
-   [plot.style\_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_circles) and [plot.style\_cross](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_cross): These plot a shape that is not joined across bars unless `join = true` is also used. For these styles, the `linewidth` argument becomes a relative sizing measure — its units are not pixels.

`trackprice`

The default value of this is `false`. When it is `true`, a dotted line made up of small squares will be plotted the full width of the script’s visual space. It is often used in conjuction with `show_last = 1, offset = -99999` to hide the actual plot and only leave the residual dotted line.

`histbase`

It is the reference point used with [plot.style\_area](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_area), [plot.style\_columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_columns) and [plot.style\_histogram](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_histogram). It determines the level separating positive and negative values of the `series` argument. It cannot be calculated dynamically, as an “input int/float” is required.

`offset`

This allows shifting the plot in the past/future using a negative/positive offset in bars. The value cannot change during the script’s execution.

`join`

This only affect styles [plot.style\_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_circles) or [plot.style\_cross](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_cross). When `true`, the shapes are joined by a one-pixel line.

`editable`

This boolean parameter controls whether or not the plot’s properties can be edited in the “Settings/Style” tab. Its default value is `true`.

`show_last`

Controls the number of bars on which the plot values are visible, counting *backward* from the last bar. Bars beyond the specified amount show [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values for this plot. It accepts an “input int” type argument, so it cannot be calculated dynamically.

`display`

Controls the locations where plot values appear, which include the script pane, status line, price scale, and Data Window. The default is [display.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_display.all). This parameter supports addition and subtraction of `display.*` options, e.g., `display.all - display.pane` hides the pane visuals but displays the plot’s numeric results everywhere else, while `display.status_line + display.data_window` displays results only in those two locations.

When this parameter is set to [display.none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_display.none), the script calculates the plot values, but does not display them in the script pane, status line, or Data Window, and the hidden plot does not affect the scale of the script’s visual space. This display option can be useful for plots intended for use as external inputs for other scripts, or for plots used with the `{{plot("[plot_title]")}}` placeholder in [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) calls, e.g.:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("")
r = ta.rsi(close, 14)
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
plot(r, "RSI", display = display.none)
alertcondition(xUp, "xUp alert", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot("RSI")}}')
```

`format`

Specifies the numeric format used to represent plot values in the status line, Data Window, and price scale. It accepts one of the following values: [format.price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_format.price), [format.percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_format.percent), or [format.volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_format.volume).

By default, the plot uses the same format as the script’s [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement. If the plot and declaration use different formats, then the plot’s `format` argument takes precedence.

`precision`

Specifies the number of digits included after the decimal point for the plot’s numeric values. It accepts a positive integer argument from 0 to 16. This precision affects the results displayed in the status line, Data Window, and price scale.

By default, the plot uses the same precision as the script’s [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement. If the plot and declaration use different precisions, then the plot’s `precision` argument takes precedence.

The `precision` parameter does not affect plot results formatted using the [format.volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_format.volume) argument, because the decimal precision rules of the volume formatting take precedence.

`force_overlay`

If `true`, the plotted results display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is `false`.

`linestyle`

Controls the style of plotted lines, using one of the following arguments: [plot.linestyle\_solid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.linestyle_solid), [plot.linestyle\_dashed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.linestyle_dashed), or [plot.linestyle\_dotted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.linestyle_dotted).

This parameter only modifies lines, so the `style` parameter must use one of the following arguments: [plot.style\_line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_line) (the default), [plot.style\_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_linebr), [plot.style\_stepline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_stepline), [plot.style\_stepline\_diamond](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_stepline_diamond), or [plot.style\_area](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_area) for it to take effect.

## Plotting conditionally

Scripts cannot call the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function from conditional structures such as [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) blocks, but can control plots by varying their plotted values or their color. When no plot is required, you can either plot [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values, or plot values using [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) color or any color with 100 transparency (which also makes it invisible).

### Value control

One way to control the display of plots is to plot [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values when no plot is needed. Sometimes, values returned by functions such as [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) will return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values, when `gaps = barmerge.gaps_on` is used, for example. In both these cases it is sometimes useful to plot discontinuous lines. This script shows a few ways to do it:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-PlottingConditionally-01.DCGRnCbX_1NjoOk.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Discontinuous plots", "", true)
bool plotValues = bar_index % 3 == 0
plot(plotValues ? high : na, color = color.fuchsia, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(plotValues ? high : na)
plot(plotValues ? math.max(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_cross)
plot(plotValues ? math.min(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(plotValues ? low : na, color = plotValues ? color.green : na, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_stepline)
```

Note that:

-   We define the condition determining when we plot using `bar_index % 3 == 0`, which becomes `true` when the remainder of the division of the bar index by 3 is zero. This will happen every three bars.
-   In the first plot, we use [plot.style\_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_linebr), which plots the fuchsia line on highs. It is centered on the bar’s horizontal midpoint.
-   The second plot shows the result of plotting the same values, but without using special care to break the line. What’s happening here is that the thin blue line of the plain [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call is automatically bridged over [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values (or *gaps*), so the plot does not interrupt.
-   We then plot navy blue crosses and circles on the body tops and bottoms. The [plot.style\_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_circles) and [plot.style\_cross](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_cross) style are a simple way to plot discontinuous values, e.g., for stop or take profit levels, or support & resistance levels.
-   The last plot in green on the bar lows is done using [plot.style\_stepline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_stepline). Note how its segments are wider than the fuchsia line segments plotted with [plot.style\_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_linebr). Also note how on the last bar, it only plots halfway until the next bar comes in.
-   The plotting order of each plot is controlled by their order of appearance in the script.

This script shows how you can restrict plotting to bars after a user-defined date. We use the [input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time) function to create an input widget allowing script users to select a date and time, using Jan 1st 2021 as its default value:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
startInput = input.time(timestamp("2021-01-01"))
plot(time > startInput ? close : na)
```

### Color control

The [Conditional coloring](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/colors/#conditional-coloring) section of the [Colors](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/colors/) page discusses color control for plots. We’ll look here at a few examples.

The value of the `color` parameter in [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) can be a constant, such as one of the built-in [constant colors](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/colors/#constant-colors) or a [color literal](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#color). In Pine Script, the qualified type of such colors is called **“const color”** (see the [Type system](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/) page). They are known at compile time:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plot(close, color = color.gray)
```

The color of a plot can also be determined using information that is only known when the script begins execution on the first historical bar of a chart (bar zero, i.e., `bar_index == 0` or `barstate.isfirst == true`), as will be the case when the information needed to determine a color depends on the chart the script is running on. Here, we calculate a plot color using the [syminfo.type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.type) built-in variable, which returns the type of the chart’s symbol. The qualified type of `plotColor` in this case will be **“simple color”**:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plotColor = switch syminfo.type
    "stock"     => color.purple
    "futures"   => color.red
    "index"     => color.gray
    "forex"     => color.fuchsia
    "crypto"    => color.lime
    "fund"      => color.orange
    "dr"        => color.aqua
    "cfd"       => color.blue
plot(close, color = plotColor)
printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
printTable(syminfo.type)
```

Plot colors can also be chosen through a script’s inputs. In this case, the `lineColorInput` variable is of the **“input color”** type:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
color lineColorInput  = input(#1848CC, "Line color")
plot(close, color = lineColorInput)
```

Finally, plot colors can also be *dynamic* values, i.e., calculated values that can change on each bar. These values are of the **“series color”** type:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plotColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
plot(close, color = plotColor)
```

When plotting pivot levels, one common requirement is to avoid plotting level transitions. Using [lines](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/lines-and-boxes/) is one alternative, but you can also use [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) like this:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-PlottingConditionally-02.Dgz5RTVC_Z2npVgz.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Pivot plots", "", true)
pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))
plot(pivotHigh, "High pivot", ta.change(pivotHigh) != 0 ? na : color.olive, 3)
plotchar(ta.change(pivotHigh), "ta.change(pivotHigh)", "•", location.top, size = size.small)
```

Note that:

-   We use `pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))` to hold our pivot values. Because [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.pivothigh) only returns a value when a new pivot is found, we use [fixnan()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fixnan) to fill the gaps with the last pivot value returned. The gaps here refer to the [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.pivothigh) returns when no new pivot is found.
-   Our pivots are detected three bars after they occur because we use the argument `3` for both the `leftbars` and `rightbars` parameters in our [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.pivothigh) call.
-   The last plot is plotting a continuous value, but it is setting the plot’s color to [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) when the pivot’s value changes, so the plot isn’t visible then. Because of this, a visible plot will only appear on the bar following the one where we plotted using [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) color.
-   The blue dot indicates when a new high pivot is detected and no plot is drawn between the preceding bar and that one. Note how the pivot on the bar indicated by the arrow has just been detected in the realtime bar, three bars later, and how no plot is drawn. The plot will only appear on the next bar, making the plot visible **four bars** after the actual pivot.

## Levels

The [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline) function plots horizontal lines at fixed levels (see the page on [Levels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/levels/)). The [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline) function is useful because it has some unique line styles that are not available with [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), and is often more performant than similar [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) lines. However, it also has some limitations, namely that it does not accept “series color” arguments, and that its `price` parameter requires an “input int/float” type, so it cannot vary during the script’s execution. In cases where scripts need to use dynamically calculated prices or colors, the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function can create similar horizontal levels.

You can plot levels with [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) in a few different ways. This script shows a [CCI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502001) indicator with levels plotted using [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot):

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-Levels-01.jio4KIpw_Z2s6Io2.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("CCI levels with `plot()`")
plot(ta.cci(close, 20))
plot(0,  "Zero", color.gray, 1, plot.style_circles)
plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ?  100 : na,  "100", color.lime, 1, plot.style_linebr)
plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ? -100 : na, "-100", color.fuchsia, 1, plot.style_linebr)
plot( 200,  "200", color.green, 2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
plot(-200, "-200", color.red,   2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
plot( 300,  "300", color.new(color.green, 50), 1)
plot(-300, "-300", color.new(color.red, 50),   1)
```

Note that:

-   The zero level is plotted using [plot.style\_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_circles).
-   The 100 levels are plotted using a conditional value that only plots every second bar. In order to prevent the [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values from being bridged, we use the [plot.style\_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_linebr) line style.
-   The 200 levels are plotted using `trackprice = true` to plot a distinct pattern of small squares that extends the full width of the script’s visual space. The `show_last = 1` in there displays only the last plotted value, which would appear as a one-bar straight line if the next trick wasn’t also used: the `offset = -99999` pushes that one-bar segment far away in the past so that it is never visible.
-   The 300 levels are plotted using a continuous line, but a lighter transparency is used to make them less prominent.

## Offsets

The `offset` parameter specifies the number of bars into the past or future that a script plots a given series. By default, a plot’s offset is zero, so each plot point aligns with its bar. Negative offsets display plots on bars *before* the current bar, while positive offsets display them on future bars.

For example, this script plots two [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) series. It displays the values in the *red* series five bars to the left because its `offset` argument is negative, while displaying the values in the *green* series five bars to the right because its `offset` is positive:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-Offsets-01.CBzf5b6H_1aubfP.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plot(close, "Offset of -5 (in the past)",   color = color.red, offset = -5)
plot(close, "Offset of +5 (in the future)", color = color.lime, offset = 5)
```

Note that:

-   The argument for the `offset` parameter cannot be of type “series”; it must be a “simple” value, which does *not* change during script execution.

## Plot count limit

Each script is limited to a maximum plot count of 64. All `plot*()` calls and [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) calls count towards the plot count of a script. Depending on the complexity of the plot and its arguments, certain calls count as *more than one* plot in the total plot count.

For example, a [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call counts as *one* plot in the total plot count if it uses a “const color” argument for its `color` parameter, because the color is known at compile time:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
plot(close, color = color.green)
```

A [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call counts as *two* plots in the total plot count if it uses a stronger [qualified type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#qualifiers) for its `color` argument, such as any one of the following, because the resulting color is dynamic:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
plot(close, color = syminfo.mintick > 0.0001 ? color.green : color.red) //🠆 "simple color"
plot(close, color = input.color(color.purple)) //🠆 "input color"
plot(close, color = close > open ? color.green : color.red) //🠆 "series color"
plot(close, color = color.new(color.silver, close > open ? 40 : 0)) //🠆 "series color"
```

See the [Plot limits](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/limitations/#plot-limits) section of the [Limitations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/limitations/) page for more information.

## Scale

Not all values can be plotted everywhere. Your script’s visual space is always bound by upper and lower limits that are dynamically adjusted with the values plotted. An [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338) indicator will plot values between 0 and 100, which is why it is usually displayed in a distinct *pane* — or area — above or below the chart. If RSI values were plotted as an overlay on the chart, the effect would be to distort the symbol’s normal price scale, unless it just hapenned to be close to RSI’s 0 to 100 range. This shows an RSI signal line and a centerline at the 50 level, with the script running in a separate pane:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-Scale-01.CE6dQl_T_1UEEw.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("RSI")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red,   0), color.new(color.red, 70))
myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
hline(50)
```

Note that the *y* axis of our script’s visual space is automatically sized using the range of values plotted, i.e., the values of RSI. See the page on [Colors](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/colors/) for more information on the [color.from\_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.from_gradient) function used in the script.

If we try to plot the symbol’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values in the same space by adding the following line to our script:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
plot(close)
```

This is what happens:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-Scale-02.D8wP6yEJ_Z1txJ3M.webp)

The chart is on the BTCUSD symbol, whose [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices are around 40000 during this period. Plotting values in the 40000 range makes our RSI plots in the 0 to 100 range indiscernible. The same distorted plots would occur if we placed the [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338) indicator on the chart as an overlay.

### Merging two indicators

If you are planning to merge two signals in one script, first consider the scale of each. It is impossible, for example, to correctly plot an [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338) and a [MACD](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502344) in the same script’s visual space because RSI has a fixed range (0 to 100) while MACD doesn’t, as it plots moving averages calculated on price.

If both your indicators used fixed ranges, you can shift the values of one of them so they do not overlap. We could, for example, plot both [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338) (0 to 100) and the [True Strength Indicator (TSI)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592290) (-100 to +100) by displacing one of them. Our strategy here will be to compress and shift the [TSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592290) values so they plot over [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338):

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Plots-Scale-03.D9mEXIxt_ZtI6jd.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("RSI and TSI")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red,   0), color.new(color.red, 70))
myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
hline(100)
hline(50)
hline(0)

// 1. Compress TSI's range from -100/100 to -50/50.
// 2. Shift it higher by 150, so its -50 min value becomes 100.
myTSI = 150 + (100 * ta.tsi(close, 13, 25) / 2)
plot(myTSI, "TSI", color.blue, 2)
plot(ta.ema(myTSI, 13), "TSI EMA", #FF006E)
hline(200)
hline(150)
```

Note that:

-   We have added levels using [hline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline) to situate both signals.
    
-   In order for both signal lines to oscillate on the same range of 100, we divide the [TSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592290) value by 2 because it has a 200 range (-100 to +100). We then shift this value up by 150 so it oscillates between 100 and 200, making 150 its centerline.
    
-   The manipulations we make here are typical of the compromises required to bring two indicators with different scales in the same visual space, even when their values, contrary to [MACD](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502344), are bounded in a fixed range.
