## Introduction

In Pine Script®, the following key aspects apply when working with date and time values:

-   **UNIX timestamp**: The native format for time values in Pine, representing the absolute number of *milliseconds* elapsed since midnight [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) on 1970-01-01. Several built-ins return UNIX timestamps directly, which users can [format](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) into readable dates and times. See the [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) section below for more information.
-   **Exchange time zone**: The [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones) of the instrument’s exchange. All [calendar-based variables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#calendar-based-variables) hold values expressed in the exchange time zone, and all built-in function overloads that have a `timezone` parameter use this time zone by default.
-   **Chart time zone**: The time zone the chart and [Pine Logs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/debugging/#pine-logs) message prefixes use to express time values. Users can set the chart time zone using the “Timezone” input in the “Symbol” tab of the chart’s settings. This setting only changes the *display* of dates and times on the chart and the times that prefix logged messages. It does **not** affect the behavior of Pine scripts because they cannot access a chart’s time zone information.
-   **`timezone` parameter**: A “string” parameter of time-related functions that specifies the time zone used in their calculations. For [calendar-based functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#calendar-based-functions), such as [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), the `timezone` parameter determines the time zone of the returned value. For functions that return UNIX timestamps, such as [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time), the specified `timezone` defines the time zone of other applicable parameters, e.g., `session`. See the [Time zone strings](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) section to learn more.

## UNIX timestamps

[UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) is a standardized date and time representation that measures the number of *non-leap seconds* elapsed since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (the *UNIX Epoch*), typically expressed in seconds or smaller time units. A UNIX time value in Pine Script is an “int” *timestamp* representing the number of *milliseconds* from the UNIX Epoch to a specific point in time.

Because a UNIX timestamp represents the number of consistent time units elapsed from a fixed historical point (epoch), its value is **time zone-agnostic**. A UNIX timestamp in Pine always corresponds to the same distinct point in time, accurate to the millisecond, regardless of a user’s location.

For example, the UNIX timestamp `1723472500000` always represents the time 1,723,472,500,000 milliseconds (1,723,472,500 seconds) after the UNIX Epoch. This timestamp’s meaning does **not** change relative to any [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones).

To *format* an “int” UNIX timestamp into a readable date/time “string” expressed in a specific time zone, use the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function. The function does not *modify* UNIX timestamps. It simply *represents* timestamps in a desired human-readable format.

For instance, the function can represent the UNIX timestamp `1723472500000` as a “string” in several ways, depending on its `format` and `timezone` arguments, without changing the *absolute* point in time that it refers to. The simple script below calculates three valid representations of this timestamp and displays them in the [Pine Logs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/debugging/#pine-logs) pane:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("UNIX timestamps demo")

//@variable A UNIX time value representing the specific point 1,723,472,500,000 ms after the UNIX Epoch. 
int unixTimestamp = 1723472500000

// These are a few different ways to express the `unixTimestamp` in a relative, human-readable format.
// Despite their format and time zone differences, all the calculated strings represent the SAME distinct point: 
string isoExchange  = str.format_time(unixTimestamp)
string utcDateTime  = str.format_time(unixTimestamp, "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss.S", "UTC+0")
string utc4TimeDate = str.format_time(unixTimestamp, "hh:mm:ss a, MMMM dd, yyyy z", "UTC+4")

// Log the `unixTimestamp` and the custom "string" representations on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    log.info(
         "\nUNIX time (ms): {0, number, #}\n
         ISO 8601 representation (Exchange time zone): {1}\n
         Custom date and time representation (UTC+0 time zone): {2}\n
         Custom time and date representation (UTC+4 time zone): {3}",
         unixTimestamp, isoExchange, utcDateTime, utc4TimeDate
     )
```

Note that:

-   The value enclosed within square brackets in the logged message is an *automatic* prefix representing the historical time of the [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info) call in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, expressed in the [chart time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones).

See the [Formatting dates and times](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) section to learn more about representing UNIX timestamps with formatted strings.

## Time zones

A [time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone) is a geographic region with an assigned *local time*. The specific time within a time zone is consistent throughout the region. Time zone boundaries typically relate to a location’s longitude. However, in practice, they tend to align with administrative boundaries rather than strictly following longitudinal lines.

The local time within a time zone depends on its defined *offset* from [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time), which can range from UTC-12:00 (12 hours *behind* UTC) to UTC+14:00 (14 hours *ahead* of UTC). Some regions maintain a consistent offset from UTC, and others have an offset that changes over time due to [daylight saving time (DST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) and other factors.

Two primary time zones apply to data feeds and TradingView charts: the *exchange time zone* and the *chart time zone*.

The exchange time zone represents the time zone of the current symbol’s *exchange*, which Pine scripts can access with the [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) variable. [Calendar-based variables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#calendar-based-variables), such as [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month), [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek), and [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour), always hold values expressed in the exchange time zone, and all time function overloads that have a `timezone` parameter use this time zone by default.

The chart time zone is a *visual preference* that defines how the chart and the time prefixes of [Pine Logs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/debugging/#pine-logs) represent time values. To set the chart time zone, use the “Timezone” input in the “Symbol” tab of the chart’s settings or click on the current time shown below the chart. The specified time zone does **not** affect time calculations in Pine scripts because they cannot access this chart information. Although scripts cannot access a chart’s time zone, programmers can provide [inputs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/) that users can adjust to match the time zone.

For example, the script below uses [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) to represent the last historical bar’s opening and closing [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) ([time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) values) as date-time strings expressed in the function’s default time zone, the exchange time zone, UTC-0, and a user-specified time zone. It uses a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) to display all four representations in the bottom-right corner of the chart for comparison:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-zones-1.BAv9QYBX_jNyY.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Time zone comparison demo", overlay = true) 

//@variable The time zone of the time values in the last table row. 
//          The "string" can contain either UTC offset notation or an IANA time zone identifier. 
string timezoneInput = input.string("UTC+4:00", "Time zone")

//@variable A `table` showing strings representing bar times in three preset time zones and a custom time zone. 
var table displayTable = table.new(
     position.bottom_right, columns = 3, rows = 5, border_color = chart.fg_color, border_width = 2
 )

//@function Initializes three `displayTable` cells on the `row` that show the `title`, `text1`, and `text2` strings. 
tableRow(int row, string title, string text1, string text2, color titleColor = #9b27b066, color infoColor = na) =>
    displayTable.cell(0, row, title, bgcolor = titleColor, text_color = chart.fg_color)
    displayTable.cell(1, row, text1, bgcolor = infoColor,  text_color = chart.fg_color)
    displayTable.cell(2, row, text2, bgcolor = infoColor,  text_color = chart.fg_color)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Draw an empty label to signify the bar that the displayed time strings represent.
    label.new(bar_index, high, color = #9b27b066, size = size.huge)

    //@variable The formatting string for all `str.format_time()` calls. Sets the format of the date-time strings. 
    var string formatString = "yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ss"
    // Initialize a header row at the top of the `displayTable`.
    tableRow(0, "", "OPEN time", "CLOSE time", na, #9b27b066)
    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the default time zone (no specified `timezone` arguments).
    tableRow(1, "Default", str.format_time(time, formatString), str.format_time(time_close, formatString))
    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the exchange time zone (`syminfo.timezone`).
    tableRow(2, "Exchange: " + syminfo.timezone, 
         str.format_time(time, formatString, syminfo.timezone),
         str.format_time(time_close, formatString, syminfo.timezone)
     )  
    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the UTC-0 time zone (using "UTC" as the `timezone` arguments).
    tableRow(3, "UTC-0", str.format_time(time, formatString, "UTC"), str.format_time(time_close, formatString, "UTC"))
    
    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the custom time zone (`timezoneInput`).
    tableRow(
         4, "Custom: " + timezoneInput, 
         str.format_time(time, formatString, timezoneInput), 
         str.format_time(time_close, formatString, timezoneInput)
     )
```

Note that:

-   The [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) on the chart signifies which bar’s times the displayed strings represent.
-   The “Default” and “Exchange” rows in the table show identical results because [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) is the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function’s default `timezone` argument.
-   The exchange time zone on our example chart appears as `"America/New_York"`, the [IANA identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for the NASDAQ exchange’s time zone. It represents UTC-4 *or* UTC-5, depending on the time of year. See the [next section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) to learn more about time zone strings.

### Time zone strings

All built-in functions with a `timezone` parameter accept a “string” argument specifying the [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones) they use in their calculations. These functions can accept time zone strings in either of the following formats:

-   **UTC** (or *GMT*) offset notation, e.g., `"UTC-5"`, `"UTC+05:30"`, `"GMT+0100"`
-   **IANA database** notation, e.g., `"America/New_York"`, `"Asia/Calcutta"`, `"Europe/Paris"`

The [IANA time zone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) reference page lists possible time zone identifiers and their respective UTC offsets. The listed identifiers are valid as `timezone` arguments.

Note that various time zone strings expressed in UTC or IANA notation can represent the *same* offset from Coordinated Universal Time. For instance, these strings all represent a local time three hours ahead of UTC:

-   `"UTC+3"`
-   `"GMT+03:00"`
-   `"Asia/Kuwait"`
-   `"Europe/Moscow"`
-   `"Africa/Nairobi"`

For the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function and the functions that calculate calendar-based values from a [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps), including [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), and [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour), the “string” passed to the `timezone` parameter changes the returned value’s calculation to express the result in the specified time zone. See the [Formatting dates and times](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) and [Calendar-based functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#calendar-based-functions) sections for more information.

The example below shows how time zone strings affect the returned values of calendar-based functions. This script uses three [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) function calls to calculate “int” values representing the opening hour of each bar in the exchange time zone, UTC-0, and a user-specified UTC offset. It plots all three calculated hours in a separate pane for comparison:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-zones-Time-zone-strings-1.CWMAwPYS_ZN7mN7.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Time zone strings in calendar functions demo")

//@variable An "int" representing the user-specified hourly offset from UTC. 
int utcOffsetInput = input.int(defval = 4, title ="Timezone offset UTC (+/-)", minval = -12, maxval = 14)

//@variable A valid time zone string based on the `utcOffsetInput`, in UTC offset notation (e.g., "UTC-4").
string customOffset = "UTC" + (utcOffsetInput > 0 ? "+" : "") + str.tostring(utcOffsetInput)

//@variable The bar's opening hour in the exchange time zone (default). Equivalent to the `hour` variable.
int exchangeHour = hour(time)
//@variable The bar's opening hour in the "UTC-0" time zone. 
int utcHour = hour(time, "UTC-0")
//@variable The bar's opening hour in the `customOffset` time zone.
int customOffsetHour = hour(time, customOffset)

// Plot the `exchangeHour`, `utcHour`, and `customOffsetHour` for comparison.
plot(exchangeHour,     "Exchange hour",      #E100FF5B,    8)
plot(utcHour,          "UTC-0 hour",         color.blue,   3)
plot(customOffsetHour, "Custom offset hour", color.orange, 3)
```

Note that:

-   The `exchangeHour` value is four *or* five hours behind the `utcHour` because the NASDAQ exchange is in the “America/New\_York” time zone. This time zone has a UTC offset that *changes* during the year due to daylight saving time (DST). The script’s default `customOffsetHour` is consistently four hours ahead of the `utcHour` because its time zone is UTC+4.
-   The call to the [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) function without a specified `timezone` argument returns the same value that the [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour) *variable* holds because both represent the bar’s opening hour in the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).

For functions that return [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) directly, such as [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp), the `timezone` parameter defines the time zone of the function’s calendar-based *parameters*, including `session`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. The parameter does *not* determine the time zone of the returned value, as UNIX timestamps are *time zone-agnostic*. See the [Testing for sessions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#testing-for-sessions) and [\`timestamp()\`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#timestamp) sections to learn more.

The following script calls the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function to calculate the UNIX timestamp of a specific date and time, and it draws a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) at the timestamp’s corresponding bar location. The user-selected `timezone` argument (`timezoneInput`) determines the time zone of the call’s calendar-based arguments. Consequently, the calculated timestamp varies with the `timezoneInput` value because identical local times in various time zones correspond to *different* amounts of time elapsed since the [UNIX Epoch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps):

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-zones-Time-zone-strings-2.Bgcl5BRA_Z1UUd3e.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Time zone strings in UNIX timestamp functions demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The `timezone` argument of the `timestamp()` call, which sets the time zone of all date and time parameters.
string timezoneInput = input.string("Etc/UTC", "Time zone")

//@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to a specific calendar date and time.
//          The specified `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second` represent calendar values in the 
//          `timezoneInput` time zone. 
//          Different `timezone` arguments produce different UNIX timestamps because an identical date in another 
//          time zone does NOT represent the same absolute point in time.
int unixTimestamp = timestamp(
     timezone = timezoneInput, year = 2024, month = 10, day = 31, hour = 0, minute = 0, second = 0
 )

//@variable The `close` value when the bar's opening time crosses the `unixTimestamp`.
float labelPrice = ta.valuewhen(ta.cross(time, unixTimestamp), close, 0)

// On the last historical bar, draw a label showing the `unixTimestamp` value at the corresponding bar location.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    label.new(
         unixTimestamp, nz(labelPrice, close), "UNIX timestamp: " + str.tostring(unixTimestamp), 
         xloc.bar_time, yloc.price, chart.fg_color, label.style_label_down, chart.bg_color, size.large
     )
```

Note that:

-   `"Etc/UTC"` is the *IANA identifier* for the UTC+0 time zone.
-   The [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call uses [xloc.bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc.bar_time) as its `xloc` argument, which is required to anchor the drawing to an absolute time value. Without this argument, the function treats the `unixTimestamp` as a relative bar index, leading to an incorrect location.
-   The label’s `y` value is the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) of the bar where the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value crosses the `unixTimestamp` value. If the timestamp represents a future time, the label displays the last historical bar’s price.

Although time zone strings can use either UTC or IANA notation, we recommend using *IANA notation* for `timezone` arguments in most cases, especially if a script’s time calculations must align with the observed time offset in a specific country or subdivision. When a time function call uses an [IANA time zone identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for its `timezone` argument, its calculations adjust automatically for historical and future changes to the specified region’s observed time, such as daylight saving time (DST) and updates to time zone boundaries, instead of using a fixed offset from UTC.

The following script demonstrates how UTC and IANA time zone strings can affect time calculations differently. It uses two calls to the [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) function to calculate the hour from the current bar’s opening timestamp using `"UTC-4"` and `"America/New_York"` as `timezone` arguments. The script plots the results of both calls for comparison and colors the main pane’s background when the returned values do not match. Although these two [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) calls may seem similar because UTC-4 is an observed UTC offset in New York, they *do not* always return the same results, as shown below:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-zones-Time-zone-strings-3.dJwwxe9V_1a20aC.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("UTC vs IANA time zone strings demo")

//@variable The hour of the current `time` in the "UTC-4" time zone. 
//          This variable's value represents the hour in New York only during DST. It is one hour ahead otherwise.
int hourUTC = hour(time, "UTC-4")
//@variable The hour of the current `time` in the "America/New_York" time zone. 
//          This form adjusts to UTC offset changes automatically, so the value always represents the hour in New York. 
int hourIANA = hour(time, "America/New_York")

//@variable Is translucent blue when `hourUTC` does not equal `hourIANA`, `na` otherwise.
color bgColor = hourUTC != hourIANA ? color.rgb(33, 149, 243, 80) : na

// Plot the values of `hourUTC` and `hourIANA` for comparison.
plot(hourUTC,  "UTC-4",            color.blue,   linewidth = 6)
plot(hourIANA, "America/New_York", color.orange, linewidth = 3)
// Highlight the main chart pane with the `bgColor`.
bgcolor(bgColor, title = "Unequal result highlight", force_overlay = true)
```

The plots in the chart above diverge periodically because New York observes daylight saving time, meaning its UTC offset *changes* at specific points in a year. During DST, New York’s local time follows UTC-4. Otherwise, it follows UTC-5. Because the script’s first [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) call uses `"UTC-4"` as its `timezone` argument, it returns the correct hour in New York *only* during DST. In contrast, the call that uses the `"America/New_York"` time zone string adjusts its UTC offset automatically to return the correct hour in New York at *any* time of the year.

## Time variables

Pine Script has several built-in variables that provide scripts access to different forms of time information:

-   The [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variables hold [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) representing the current bar’s opening and closing times, respectively.
-   The [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the starting time of the last UTC calendar day in a session.
-   The [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the current time when the script executes.
-   The [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year), [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month), [weekofyear](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_weekofyear), [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth), [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek), [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour), [minute](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_minute), and [second](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_second) variables reference calendar values based on the current bar’s opening time, expressed in the [exchange time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones).
-   The [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the last available bar’s opening time.
-   The [chart.left\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) variables hold UNIX timestamps representing the opening times of the leftmost and rightmost visible chart bars.
-   The [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) variable holds a “string” value representing the [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones) of the current symbol’s exchange in [IANA database notation](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings). All time-related function overloads with a `timezone` parameter use this variable as the default argument.

### ​time​ and ​time\_close​ variables

The [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) variable holds the [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) of the current bar’s *opening time*, and the [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variable holds the UNIX timestamp of the bar’s *closing time*.

These timestamps are unique, time zone-agnostic “int” values, which programmers can use to anchor [drawing objects](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#drawing-types) to specific bar times, calculate and inspect bar time differences, construct readable date/time strings with the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function, and more.

The script below displays bar opening and closing times in different ways. On each bar, it [formats](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) timestamps into strings containing the hour, minute, and second in the [exchange time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones), and it draws [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) displaying the formatted strings at the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices. Additionally, the script displays strings containing the unformatted UNIX timestamps of the last chart bar within a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) in the bottom-right corner:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`time` and `time_close` demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable A "string" representing the hour, minute, and second of the bar's opening time in the exchange time zone. 
string openTimeString = str.format_time(time, "HH:mm:ss")
//@variable A "string" representing the hour, minute, and second of the bar's closing time in the exchange time zone.
string closeTimeString = str.format_time(time_close, "HH:mm:ss")

//@variable Is `label.style_label_down` when the `open` is higher than `close`, `label.style_label_up` otherwise.
string openLabelStyle  = open > close ? label.style_label_down : label.style_label_up
//@variable Is `label.style_label_down` when the `close` is higher than `open`, `label.style_label_up` otherwise.
string closeLabelStyle = close > open ? label.style_label_down : label.style_label_up

// Draw labels anchored to the bar's `time` to display the `openTimeString` and `closeTimeString`.
label.new(time, open,  openTimeString,  xloc.bar_time, yloc.price, color.orange, openLabelStyle,  color.white)
label.new(time, close, closeTimeString, xloc.bar_time, yloc.price, color.blue,   closeLabelStyle, color.white)
 
if barstate.islast
    //@variable A `table` displaying the last bar's *unformatted* UNIX timestamps. 
    var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 2, 2, bgcolor = #ffe70d)
    // Populate the `t` table with "string" representations of the the "int" `time` and `time_close` values. 
    t.cell(0, 0, "`time`")
    t.cell(1, 0, str.tostring(time))
    t.cell(0, 1, "`time_close`")
    t.cell(1, 1, str.tostring(time_close))
```

Note that:

-   This script’s [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) calls include [xloc.bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc.bar_time) as the `xloc` argument and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) as the `x` argument to anchor the drawings to bar opening times.
-   The formatted strings express time in the exchange time zone because we did not specify `timezone` arguments in the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) calls. NYSE, our chart symbol’s exchange, is in the “America/New\_York” time zone (UTC-4/-5).
-   Although our example chart uses an *hourly* timeframe, the [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) and the [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) at the end of the chart show that the last bar closes only *30 minutes* (1,800,000 milliseconds) after opening. This behavior occurs because the chart aligns bars with [session](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/) opening and closing times. A session’s final bar closes when the session ends, and a new bar opens when a new session starts. A typical session on our 60-minute chart with regular trading hours (RTH) spans from 09:30 to 16:00 (6.5 hours). The chart divides this interval into as many 60-minute bars as possible, starting from the session’s opening time, which leaves only 30 minutes for the final bar to cover.

It’s crucial to note that unlike the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) variable, which has consistent behavior across chart types, [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) behaves differently on *time-based* and *non-time-based* charts.

Time-based charts have bars that typically open and close at regular, *predictable* times within a session. Thanks to this predictability, [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) can accurately represent the *expected* closing time of an open bar on a time-based chart, as shown on the last bar in the example above.

In contrast, the bars on [tick charts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000709225/) and *price-based* charts (all [non-standard charts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/non-standard-charts-data/) excluding [Heikin Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000619436/)) cover *irregular* time intervals. Tick charts construct bars based on successive ticks in the data feed, and price-based charts construct bars based on significant price movements. The time it takes for new ticks or price changes to occur is *unpredictable*. As such, the [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) value is [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on the *open realtime bars* of these charts.

The following script uses the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variables with [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring) and [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) to create strings containing bar opening and closing [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) and [formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) date-time representations, which it displays in [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) at each bar’s [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) prices.

When applied to a [Renko](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502284/) chart, which forms new bars based on *price movements*, the labels show correct results on all historical bars. However, the last bar has a [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) value of [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) because the future closing time is unpredictable. Consequently, the bar’s closing time label shows a timestamp of `"NaN"` and an *incorrect* date and time:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-variables-Time-and-time-close-2.DgbsHPgj_1bCOHq.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`time_close` on non-time-based chart demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A formatted "string" containing the date and time that `time_close` represents in the exchange time zone.
string formattedCloseTime = str.format_time(time_close, format = "'Date and time:' yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
//@variable A formatted "string" containing the date and time that `time` represents in the exchange time zone.
string formattedOpenTime = str.format_time(time, format = "'Date and time:' yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

//@variable A "string" containing the `time_close` UNIX timestamp and the `formattedCloseTime`.
string closeTimeText = str.format("Close timestamp: {0,number,#}\n{1}", time_close, formattedCloseTime)
//@variable A "string" containing the `time` UNIX timestamp and the `formattedOpenTime`.
string openTimeText = str.format("Open timestamp: {0,number,#}\n{1}", time, formattedOpenTime)

// Define label colors for historical and realtime bars. 
color closeLabelColor = barstate.islast ? color.purple : color.aqua
color openLabelColor  = barstate.islast ? color.green  : color.orange

// Draw a label at the `high` to display the `closeTimeText` and a label at the `low` to display the `openTimeText`, 
// both anchored to the bar's `time`. 
label.new(
      time, high, closeTimeText, xloc.bar_time, color = closeLabelColor, textcolor = color.white, 
      size = size.large, textalign = text.align_left
 )
label.new(
      time, low, openTimeText, xloc.bar_time, color = openLabelColor, style = label.style_label_up, 
      size = size.large, textcolor = color.white, textalign = text.align_left
 )

// Highlight the background yellow on the latest bar. 
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? #f3de22cb : na, title = "Latest bar highlight")
```

Note that:

-   The script draws up to 50 [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) because we did not specify a `max_labels_count` argument in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration statement.
-   The [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function replaces [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values with 0 in its calculations, which is why it returns an incorrect date-time “string” on the last bar. A timestamp of 0 corresponds to the *UNIX Epoch* (00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970). However, the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) call does not specify a `timezone` argument, so it expresses the epoch’s date and time in the *exchange time zone*, which was five hours behind UTC at that point in time.
-   The [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) function, which returns the closing timestamp of a bar on a specified timeframe within a given session, also returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on the open realtime bars of tick-based and price-based charts.

Scripts can retrieve a realtime bar’s closing time on tick charts and price-based charts once the bar is *confirmed*. The closing timestamp of an *elapsed realtime bar* is committed to the realtime data feed as soon as the bar closes, so its [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) value is no longer [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

To demonstrate this, we can modify the script above to use `time_close[1]` to output the previous bar’s closing time on each bar. The image below shows two highlighted realtime bars. When we executed the script on the chart, the first bar was initially an unconfirmed realtime bar. Its label shows the previous *historical* bar’s closing time. After some time, this realtime bar closed, and the second highlighted bar opened. The label on the new realtime bar shows the *elapsed realtime* bar’s closing time:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-variables-Time-and-time-close-3.n-klv93m_Z1gi8Rh.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`time_close[1]` on non-time-based chart demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A formatted "string" containing the date and time that `time_close[1]` represents in the exchange time zone.
string formattedCloseTime = str.format_time(time_close[1], format = "'Date and time:' yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

//@variable A "string" containing the `time_close[1]` UNIX timestamp and the `formattedCloseTime`.
string closeTimeText = str.format("Close timestamp of previous bar: {0,number,#}\n{1}", time_close[1], formattedCloseTime)

// Define label colors for historical and realtime bars. 
color closeLabelColor = barstate.islast ? color.purple : color.aqua

// Draw a label at the `high` to display the `closeTimeText` anchored to the bar's `time`. 
label.new(
      time, high, closeTimeText, xloc.bar_time, color = closeLabelColor, textcolor = color.white, 
      size = size.large, textalign = text.align_left
 ) 

// Highlight the background yellow on the realtime bar. 
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? #f3de22cb : na, title = "Realtime bar highlight")
```

Note that:

-   A confirmed realtime bar is **not** the same as a historical bar. Pine’s [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) uses separate data feeds for realtime and historical data. The closing time of a confirmed realtime bar is committed to the *realtime* feed, until the script re-executes on the chart. Only then will this bar’s closing time load *historically* along with all the other closed bars.
-   The [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast) value is `true` for all realtime bars in the dataset. Therefore, the elapsed realtime bar and the latest realtime bar both display a purple [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/text-and-shapes/#labels) and highlighted [background](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/backgrounds/). See the [Bar states](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/bar-states/) page to learn more about the different `barstate.*` variables in Pine Script.
-   The [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) function can similarly retrieve the previous bar’s closing time on price-based charts using a `bar_back = 1` argument.

### ​time\_tradingday​

The [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) variable holds a [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) representing the starting time (00:00 UTC) of the last trading day in the current bar’s final session. It is helpful primarily for date and time calculations on *time-based* charts for symbols with overnight sessions that start and end on *different* calendar days.

On “1D” and lower timeframes, the [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) timestamp corresponds to the beginning of the day when the current session *ends*, even for bars that open and close on the previous day. For example, the “Monday” session for “EURUSD” starts on Sunday at 17:00 and ends on Monday at 17:00 in the [exchange time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones). The [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) values of *all* intraday bars within the session represent Monday at 00:00 UTC.

On timeframes higher than “1D”, which can cover *multiple* sessions, [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) holds the timestamp representing the beginning of the last calendar day of the bar’s *final* trading session. For example, on a “EURUSD, 1W” chart, the timestamp represents the start of the last trading day in the week, which is typically Friday at 00:00 UTC.

The script below demonstrates how the [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) variables differ on Forex symbols. On each bar, it draws [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) to display strings containing the variables’ [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) and [formatted dates and times](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times). It also uses the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) function to calculate the UTC calendar day from both timestamps, highlighting the background when the calculated days do not match.

When applied to the “FXCM:EURUSD” chart with the “3h” (“180”) timeframe, the script highlights the background of the *first bar* in each session, as each session opens on the *previous* calendar day. The [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) call that uses [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) calculates the opening day on the session’s first bar, whereas the call that uses [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) calculates the day when the session *ends*:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`time_tradingday` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A concatenated "string" containing the `time_tradingday` timestamp and a formatted representation in UTC.
string tradingDayText = "`time_tradingday`: " + str.tostring(time_tradingday) + "\n"
     + "Date and time: " + str.format_time(time_tradingday, "dd MMM yyyy, HH:mm (z)", "UTC+0")

    label.new(time, 0, barOpenText, xloc.bar_time, labelYloc, color.maroon, labelStyle, color.white)
else
    label.new(time, 0, "\n\n\n" + barOpenText, xloc.bar_time, labelYloc, color.maroon, labelStyle, color.white)
    label.new(time, 0, tradingDayText, xloc.bar_time, labelYloc, color.teal, labelStyle, color.white)

//@variable The day of the month, in UTC, that the `time_tradingday` timestamp corresponds to. 
int tradingDayOfMonth = dayofmonth(time_tradingday, "UTC+0")
//@variable The day of the month, in UTC, that the `time` timestamp corresponds to. 
int openingDayOfMonth = dayofmonth(time, "UTC+0")

// Highlight the background when the `tradingDayOfMonth` does not equal the `openingDayOfMonth`. 
bgcolor(tradingDayOfMonth != openingDayOfMonth ? color.rgb(174, 89, 243, 85) : na, title = "Different day highlight")
```

Note that:

-   The [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) and [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) calls use `"UTC+0"` as the `timezone` argument, meaning the results represent calendar time values with no offset from UTC. In the screenshot, the first bar opens at 21:00 UTC, 17:00 in the exchange time zone (“America/New\_York”).
-   The formatted strings show `"GMT"` as the acronym of the time zone, which is equivalent to `"UTC+0"` in this context.
-   The [time\_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) value is the same for *all* three-hour bars within each session, even for the initial bar that opens on the previous UTC calendar day. The assigned timestamp changes only when a new session starts.

### ​timenow​

The [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) variable holds a [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) representing the script’s *current time*. Unlike the values of other variables that hold UNIX timestamps, the values in the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) series correspond to times when the script *executes*, not the times of specific bars or trading days.

A Pine script executes only *once* per historical bar, and all historical executions occur when the script first *loads* on the chart. As such, the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) value is relatively consistent on historical bars, with only occasional millisecond changes across the series. In contrast, on realtime bars, a script executes once for *each new update* in the data feed, which can happen several times per bar. With each new execution, the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) value updates on the latest bar to represent the current time.

NoticeBecause [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) only updates after script executions, its value does **not** always correspond to the *continuous* time displayed below the chart. When no new updates are available in the realtime data feed, a script on the chart remains *idle*, in which case the variable’s timestamp does not change.

This variable is most useful on realtime bars, where programmers can apply it to track the times of the latest script executions, count the time elapsed within open bars, control drawings based on bar updates, and more.

The script below inspects the value of [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) on the latest chart bars and uses it to analyze realtime bar updates. When the script first reaches the last chart bar, it declares three variables with the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword to hold the latest [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) value, the total time elapsed between the bar’s updates, and the total number of updates. It uses these values to calculate the average number of milliseconds between updates, which it displays in a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) along with the current execution’s timestamp, a [formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) time and date in the [exchange time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones), and the current number of bar updates:

```

Note that:

-   When a bar is open, the drawn label is blue to signify that additional updates can occur. After the bar closes, the final label’s color is gray.
-   Although we’ve set the chart [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones) to match the exchange time zone, the formatted time in the open bar’s label and the time shown below the chart *do not* always align. The script records a new timestamp only when a *new execution* occurs, whereas the time below the chart updates *continuously*.
-   The [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword specifies that a variable does not revert to the last committed value in its series when new updates occur. This behavior allows the script to use variables to track changes in [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) on an open bar.
-   Updates to [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) on open realtime bars do not affect the recorded timestamps on confirmed bars as the script executes. However, the historical series changes (*repaints*) after reloading the chart because [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) references the script’s *current time*, not the times of specific bars.

### Calendar-based variables

The [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year), [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month), [weekofyear](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_weekofyear), [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth), [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek), [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour), [minute](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_minute), and [second](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_second) variables hold *calendar-based* “int” values calculated from the current bar’s *opening time*, expressed in the [exchange time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones). These variables reference the same values that [calendar-based functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#calendar-based-functions) return when they use the default `timezone` argument and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) as the `time` argument. For instance, the [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year) variable holds the same value that a `year(time)` call returns.

Programmers can use these calendar-based variables for several purposes, such as:

-   Identifying a bar’s opening date and time.
-   Passing the variables to the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function to calculate [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps).
-   Testing when date/time values or ranges occur in a data feed.

One of the most common use cases for these variables is checking for date or time ranges to control when a script displays visuals or executes calculations. This simple example inspects the [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year) variable to determine when to plot a visible value. If the [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year) is 2022 or higher, the script plots the bar’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close). Otherwise, it plots [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na):

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-variables-Calendar-based-variables-1.kYa8Z75h_KDMyu.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`year` demo", overlay = true)

// Plot the `close` price on bars that open in the `year` 2022 onward. Otherwise, plot `na` to display nothing.
plot(year >= 2022 ? close : na, "`close` price (year 2022 and later)", linewidth = 3)
```

When using these variables in conditions that isolate specific dates or times rather than ranges, it’s crucial to consider that certain conditions might not detect some occurrences of the values due to a chart’s timeframe, the opening times of chart bars, or the symbol’s active session.

For instance, suppose we want to detect when the first calendar day of each month occurs on the chart. Intuitively, one might consider simply checking when the [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth) value equals 1. However, this condition only identifies when a bar *opens* on a month’s first day. The bars on some charts can open and close in *different* months. Additionally, a chart bar might not contain the first day of a month if the market is *closed* on that day. Therefore, we must create extra conditions that work in these scenarios to identify the first day in *any* month on the chart.

The script below uses the [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth) and [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month) variables, and the [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month) function, to create three conditions that detect the first day of the month in different ways. The first condition detects if the bar opens on the first day, the second checks if the bar opens in one month and closes in another, and the third checks if the chart skips the date entirely. The script draws [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) showing bar opening dates and highlights the background with different colors to visualize when each condition occurs:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-variables-Calendar-based-variables-2.xQSXmhyL_Zw0zRE.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Detecting the first day of the month demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable Is `true` only if the current bar opens on the first day of the month in exchange time, `false` otherwise. 
bool opensOnFirst = dayofmonth == 1
//@variable Is `true` if the bar opens in one month and closes in another, meaning its time span includes the first day.
bool containsFirst = month != month(time_close) 
//@variable Is `true` only if the bar opens in a new month and the current or previous bar does not cover the first day.
bool skipsFirst = month != month[1] and not (opensOnFirst or containsFirst[1])

//@variable The name of the current bar's opening weekday.
string weekdayName = switch dayofweek
    dayofweek.sunday    => "Sunday"
    dayofweek.monday    => "Monday"
    dayofweek.tuesday   => "Tuesday"
    dayofweek.wednesday => "Wednesday"
    dayofweek.thursday  => "Thursday"
    dayofweek.friday    => "Friday"
    dayofweek.saturday  => "Saturday"

//@variable A custom "string" representing the bar's opening date, including the weekday name. 
string openDateText = weekdayName + str.format_time(time, ", MMM d, yyyy")

// Draw a green label when the bar opens on the first day of the month. 
if opensOnFirst
    string labelText = "Bar opened on\n" + openDateText
    label.new(time, open, labelText, xloc.bar_time, color = color.green, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
// Draw a blue label when the bar opens and closes in different months. 
if containsFirst
    string labelText = "Bar includes the first day,\nbut opened on\n" + openDateText
    label.new(time, open, labelText, xloc.bar_time, color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
// Draw a red label when the chart skips the first day of the month. 
if skipsFirst
    string labelText = "Chart doesn't include the first day.\nBar opened on\n" + openDateText
    label.new(time, open, labelText, xloc.bar_time, color = color.red, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)

// Highlight the background when the conditions occur.
bgcolor(opensOnFirst ? color.new(color.green, 70) : na, title = "`opensOnFirst` condition highlight")
bgcolor(containsFirst ? color.new(color.blue, 70) : na, title = "`containsFirst` condition highlight")
bgcolor(skipsFirst ? color.new(color.red, 70) : na, title = "`skipsFirst` condition highlight")
```

Note that:

-   The script calls the [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month) function with [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) as the `time` argument to calculate each bar’s *closing* month for the `containsFirst` condition.
-   The `dayofweek.*` namespace contains variables that hold each possible [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek) value, e.g., [dayofweek.sunday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_dayofweek.sunday) has a constant value of 1 and [dayofweek.saturday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_dayofweek.saturday) has a constant value of 7. The script compares [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek) to these variables in a [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch) structure to determine the weekday name shown inside each [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label).
-   To detect the *first opening time* in a monthly timeframe, not strictly the first day in a calendar month, use `ta.change(time("1M")) > 0` or `timeframe.change("1M")` instead of conditions based on these variables. See the [Testing for changes in higher timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) section to learn more.

### ​last\_bar\_time​

The [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) variable holds a [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) representing the *last* available bar’s opening time. It is similar to [last\_bar\_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_index), which references the latest bar index. On historical bars, [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) consistently references the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value of the last bar available when the script first *loads* on the chart. The only time the variable’s value updates across script executions is when a new realtime bar opens.

The following script uses the [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) variable to get the opening timestamp of the last chart bar during its execution on the *first bar*. It displays the UNIX timestamp and a [formatted date and time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) using a single-cell [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) created only on that bar. When the script executes on the last available bar, it creates a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) to show the bar’s [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value and its formatted representation for visual comparison.

As the chart below shows, both drawings display *identical* times, verifying that [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) correctly references the last bar’s [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value on previous historical bars:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-variables-Last-bar-time-1.COWu3Po-_Z26jRdL.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`last_bar_time` demo", overlay = true)

if barstate.isfirst
    //@variable A single-cell `table`, created only on the *first* bar, showing the *last* available bar's opening time.
    table displayTable = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.aqua)
    //@variable A "string" containing the `last_bar_time` UNIX timestamp and a custom date and time representation. 
    string lastBarTimeText = "`last_bar_time`: "              + str.tostring(last_bar_time) 
                             + "\nDate and time (exchange): " + str.format_time(last_bar_time, "dd/MM/yy HH:mm:ss")
    // Initialize the `displayTable` cell with the `lastBarTimeText`.
    displayTable.cell(
         0, 0, lastBarTimeText, 
         text_color = color.white, text_size = size.large, text_halign = text.align_left
     )

//@variable Is `true` only on the first occurrence of `barstate.islast`, `false` otherwise.
//          This condition occurs on the bar whose `time` the `last_bar_time` variable refers to on historical bars.
bool isInitialLastBar = barstate.islast and not barstate.islast[1]

if isInitialLastBar
    //@variable A "string" containing the last available bar's `time` value and a custom date and time representation.
    //          Matches the `lastBarTimeText` from the first bar because `last_bar_time` equals this bar's `time`.
    string openTimeText = "`time`: "                       + str.tostring(time)
                          + "\nDate and time (exchange): " + str.format_time(time, "dd/MM/yy HH:mm:ss") 
    // Draw a label anchored to the bar's `time` to display the `openTimeText`. 
    label.new(
         time, high, openTimeText, xloc.bar_time,
         color = color.purple, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large, textalign = text.align_left
     )

// Highlight the background when `isInitialLastBar` is `true` for visual reference. 
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? color.rgb(155, 39, 176, 80) : na, title = "Initial last bar highlight")
```

Note that:

-   The script creates the [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) only on the *first* bar with the [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast) state because that bar’s [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value is what [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) equals on all historical bars. On subsequent bars, the [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) value *updates* to represent the latest realtime bar’s opening time.
-   Updates to [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) on realtime bars do not affect the values on historical bars as the script executes. However, the variable’s series *repaints* when the script restarts because [last\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) always references the latest available bar’s opening time.
-   This script expresses dates using the `"dd/MM/yy"` format, meaning the two-digit day appears before the two-digit month, and the month appears before the two-digit representation of the year. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) below for more information.

### Visible bar times

The [chart.left\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) variables reference the opening [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) of the chart’s leftmost (first) and rightmost (last) *visible bars* on every script execution. When a script uses these variables, it responds dynamically to visible chart changes, such as users scrolling across bars or zooming in/out. Each time the visible window changes, the script *re-executes* automatically to update the variables’ values on all available bars.

The example below demonstrates how the [chart.left\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) variables work across script executions. The script draws [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) anchored to the visible bars’ times to display the UNIX timestamps. In addition, it draws two single-cell [tables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/tables/) showing corresponding dates and times in the standard [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. The script creates these drawings only when it executes on the first bar. As the script continues to execute on subsequent bars, it identifies each bar whose [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value equals either visible bars’ timestamp and colors it on the chart:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-variables-Visible-bar-times-1.Cm54dJVW_rV6wP.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Visible bar times demo", overlay = true)

// Create strings on the first chart bar that contain the first and last visible bars' UNIX timestamps.
var string leftTimestampText  = str.format("UNIX timestamp: {0,number,#}", chart.left_visible_bar_time)
var string rightTimestampText = str.format("UNIX timestamp: {0,number,#}", chart.right_visible_bar_time)
// Create strings on the first bar that contain the exchange date and time of the visible bars in ISO 8601 format.
var string leftDateTimeText  = "Date and time: " + str.format_time(chart.left_visible_bar_time)
var string rightDateTimeText = "Date and time: " + str.format_time(chart.right_visible_bar_time)

//@variable A `label` object anchored to the first visible bar's time. Shows the `leftTimestampText`.
var label leftTimeLabel = label.new(
     chart.left_visible_bar_time, 0, leftTimestampText, xloc.bar_time, yloc.abovebar, color.purple, 
     label.style_label_lower_left, color.white, size.large
 )
//@variable A `label` object anchored to the last visible bar's time. Shows the `rightTimestampText`.
var label rightTimeLabel = label.new(
     chart.right_visible_bar_time, 0, rightTimestampText, xloc.bar_time, yloc.abovebar, color.teal, 
     label.style_label_lower_right, color.white, size.large
 )

//@variable A single-cell `table` object showing the `leftDateTimeText`.
var table leftTimeTable = table.new(position.middle_left, 1, 1, color.purple)
//@variable A single-cell `table` object showing the `rightDateTimeText`.
var table rightTimeTable = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1, color.teal)
// On the first bar, initialize the `leftTimeTable` and `rightTimeTable` with the corresponding date-time text.
if barstate.isfirst
    leftTimeTable.cell(0, 0, leftDateTimeText, text_color = color.white, text_size = size.large)
    rightTimeTable.cell(0, 0, rightDateTimeText, text_color = color.white, text_size = size.large)

//@variable Is purple at the left visible bar's opening time, teal at the right bar's opening time, `na` otherwise. 
color barColor = switch time
    chart.left_visible_bar_time  => color.purple
    chart.right_visible_bar_time => color.teal

// Color the leftmost and rightmost visible bars using the `barColor`.
barcolor(barColor, title = "Leftmost and rightmost visible bar color")
```

Note that:

-   The [chart.left\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) values are consistent across all executions, which allows the script to identify the visible bars’ timestamps on the *first* bar and check when the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value equals them. The script restarts on any chart window changes, updating the variables’ series to reference the new timestamps on every bar.
-   The [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function uses ISO 8601 format by default when the call does not include a `format` argument because it is the *international standard* for expressing dates and times. See the [Formatting dates and times](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) section to learn more about time string formats.

### ​syminfo.timezone​

The [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) variable holds a [time zone string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) representing the current symbol’s *exchange* time zone. The “string” value expresses the time zone as an *IANA identifier* (e.g., `"America/New_York"`). The overloads of [time functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-functions) that include a `timezone` parameter use [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) as the default argument.

Because this variable is the default `timezone` argument for all applicable time function overloads, it is unnecessary to use as an explicit argument, except for stylistic purposes. However, programmers can use the variable in other ways, such as:

-   Displaying the “string” in [Pine Logs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/debugging/#pine-logs) or [drawings](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#drawing-types) to inspect the exchange time zone’s IANA identifier.
-   Comparing the value to other time zone strings to create time zone-based conditional logic.
-   Requesting the exchange time zones of other symbols with `request.*()` function calls.

The following script uses the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) variable to retrieve the [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) of its latest execution. It [formats](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) the timestamp into date-time strings expressed in the main symbol’s exchange time zone and a requested symbol’s exchange time zone, which it displays along with the IANA identifiers in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the last chart bar:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-variables-Syminfo-timezone-1.BAiDPB0L_Z1tzhco.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`syminfo.timezone` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The symbol to request exchange time zone information for. 
string symbolInput = input.symbol("NSE:BANKNIFTY", "Requested symbol")

//@variable A `table` object displaying the exchange time zone and the time of the script's execution.
var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 2, 3, color.yellow, border_color = color.black, border_width = 1)

//@variable The IANA identifier of the exchange time zone requested for the `symbolInput` symbol.
var string requestedTimezone = na

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Retrieve the time zone of the user-specified symbol's exchange.
    requestedTimezone := request.security(symbolInput, "", syminfo.timezone, calc_bars_count = 2)
    // Initialize the `t` table's header cells.
    t.cell(0, 0, "Exchange prefix and time zone string", text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(1, 0, "Last execution date and time", text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(0, 1, syminfo.prefix(syminfo.tickerid) + " (" + syminfo.timezone + ")", text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(0, 2, syminfo.prefix(symbolInput) + " (" + requestedTimezone + ")", text_size = size.large)

if barstate.islast
    //@variable The formatting string for all `str.format_time()` calls. 
    var string formatString = "HH:mm:ss 'on' MMM dd, YYYY"
    // Initialize table cells to display the formatted text.
    t.cell(1, 1, str.format_time(timenow, formatString), text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(1, 2, str.format_time(timenow, formatString, requestedTimezone), text_size = size.large)
```

Note that:

-   Pine scripts execute on realtime bars only when new updates occur in the data feed, and [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) updates only on script executions. As such, when no realtime updates are available, the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) timestamp does not change. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#timenow) above for more information.
-   The default `symbolInput` value is `"NSE:BANKNIFTY"`. NSE is in the “Asia/Kolkata” [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones), which is 9.5 hours ahead of the main symbol’s exchange time zone (“America/New\_York”) at the time of the screenshot. Although the *local* time representations differ, both refer to the same *absolute* time that the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) timestamp represents.
-   Pine v6 scripts use dynamic `request.*()` calls by default, which allows the script to call [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) dynamically inside the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) structure’s *local scope*. See the [Dynamic requests](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/other-timeframes-and-data/#dynamic-requests) section of the [Other timeframes and data](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/other-timeframes-and-data/) page to learn more.

## Time functions

Pine Script features several built-in functions that scripts can use to retrieve, calculate, and express time values:

-   The [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions allow scripts to retrieve [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) for the opening and closing times of bars within a session on a specified timeframe, without requiring `request.*()` function calls.
-   The [year()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_year), [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [weekofyear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_weekofyear), [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth), [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour), [minute()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_minute), and [second()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_second) functions calculate calendar-based values, expressed in a specified [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones), from a UNIX timestamp.
-   The [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function calculates a UNIX timestamp from a specified calendar date and time.
-   The [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function formats a UNIX timestamp into a human-readable date/time “string”, expressed in a specified time zone. The [Formatting dates and times](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) section below provides detailed information about formatting timestamps with this function.
-   The [input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time) function returns a UNIX timestamp corresponding to the user-specified date and time, and the [input.session()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.session) function returns a valid [time-based session string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/#time-based-sessions) corresponding to the user-specified start and end times. See the [Time input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/#time-input) and [Session input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/#session-input) sections of the [Inputs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/) page to learn more about these functions.

### ​time()​ and ​time\_close()​ functions

The [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions return [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) representing the opening and closing times of bars on a specified timeframe. Both functions can *filter* their returned values based on a given [session](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/) in a specific [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones). They each have the following signatures:

```
functionName(timeframe, bars_back) → series intfunctionName(timeframe, session, bars_back) → series intfunctionName(timeframe, session, timezone, bars_back) → series int
```

Where:

-   `functionName` is the function’s identifier.
-   The `timeframe` parameter accepts a [timeframe string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/timeframes/#timeframe-string-specifications). The function uses the script’s main timeframe if the argument is [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) or an empty “string”.
-   The `session` parameter accepts a [time-based session string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/#time-based-sessions) defining the session’s start and end times (e.g., `"0930-1600"`) and the days for which it applies (e.g., `":23456"` means Monday - Friday). If the value does not specify the days, the session applies to *all* weekdays automatically. The function returns UNIX timestamps only for the bars *within* the session. It returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) if a bar’s time is *outside* the session. If the `session` argument is an empty “string” or not specified, The function uses the symbol’s session information.
-   The `timezone` parameter accepts a valid [time zone string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) that defines the time zone of the specified `session`. It does **not** change the meaning of returned UNIX timestamps, as they are *time zone-agnostic*. If the `timezone` argument is not specified, the function uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).
-   The `bars_back` parameter accepts an “int” value specifying which bar’s time the returned timestamp represents. If the value is positive, the function returns the timestamp from that number of bars back relative to the current bar. If the value is negative and greater than or equal to -500, the function returns the *expected* timestamp of a future bar. The default value is 0.

Similar to the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variables, these functions behave differently on *time-based* and *non-time-based* charts.

Time-based charts have bars that open and close at *predictable* times, whereas the bars on [tick charts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000709225/) and all [non-standard charts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/non-standard-charts-data/), excluding [Heikin Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000619436/), open and close at irregular, *unpredictable* times. Consequently, [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) cannot calculate the expected closing time of an open realtime bar on non-time-based charts, so it returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on that bar. Similarly, the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) function with a negative `bars_back` value cannot accurately calculate the expected opening time of a future realtime bar on these charts. See the *second example* in [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-and-time_close-variables) above. That example script exhibits the same behavior on a price-based chart if it uses a `time_close("")` call instead of the [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variable.

On non-time-based charts, a new bar’s closing time is available in the realtime data feed once the bar closes. Therefore, [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) can retrieve valid closing timestamps for *confirmed realtime bars* without needing to restart the script to load them historically. See the *third example* in [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-and-time_close-variables) above. Replacing the `time_close[1]` variable in the example script with a `time_close("", 1)` call achieves the same result to retrieve the closing time of the elapsed realtime bar.

Typical use cases for the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions include:

-   Testing for bars that open or close in [specific sessions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#testing-for-sessions) defined by the `session` and `timezone` parameters.
-   [Testing for changes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) or measuring time differences on specified higher timeframes.

#### Testing for sessions

The [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions’ `session` and `timezone` parameters define the [sessions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/) for which they can return *non-na* values. If a call to either function references a bar that opens/closes within the defined session in a given [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones), it returns a [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) for that bar. Otherwise, it returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na). Programmers can pass the returned values to the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) function to identify which bars open or close within specified intervals, which is helpful for session-based calculations and logic.

This simple script identifies when a bar on the chart’s timeframe opens at or after 11:00 and before 13:00 in the exchange time zone on any trading day. It calls [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) with [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) as the `timeframe` argument and the `"1100-1300"` [session string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/#time-based-sessions) as the `session` argument, and then verifies whether the returned value is [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) with the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) function. When the value is **not** [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), the script highlights the chart’s background to indicate that the bar opened in the session:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-functions-Time-and-time-close-Testing-for-sessions-1.CJeOvGxZ_Z1sBkKc.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Testing for session bars demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Checks if the bar opens between 11:00 and 13:00. Is `true` if the `time()` function does not return `na`. 
bool inSession = not na(time(timeframe.period, "1100-1300"))

// Highlight the background of the bars that are in the session "11:00-13:00". 
bgcolor(inSession ? color.rgb(155, 39, 176, 80) : na)
```

Note that:

-   The `session` argument in the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call represents an interval in the *exchange* time zone because [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) is the default `timezone` argument.
-   The session string expresses the start and end times in the `"HHmm-HHmm"` format, where `"HH"` is the two-digit *hour* and `"mm"` is the two-digit *minute*. Session strings can also specify the *weekdays* a session applies to. However, the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call’s `session` argument (`"1100-1300"`) does not include this information, which is why it considers the session valid for *every* day. See the [Sessions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/) page to learn more.

When using session strings in [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) calls, it’s crucial to understand that such strings define start and end times in a *specific* [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones). The local hour and minute in one region may not correspond to the same point in UNIX time as that same hour and minute in another region. Therefore, calls to these functions with different `timezone` arguments can return non-na timestamps at *different* times, as the specified [time zone string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) changes the meaning of the local times represented in the `session` argument.

This example demonstrates how the `timezone` parameter affects the `session` parameter in a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) function call. The script calculates an `opensInSession` condition that uses a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call with arguments based on [inputs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/). The [session input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/#session-input) for the `session` argument includes four preset options: `"0000-0400"`, `"0930-1400"`, `"1300-1700"`, and `"1700-2100"`. The [string input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/#string-input) that defines the `timezone` argument includes four IANA time zone options representing different offsets from UTC: `"America/Vancouver"` (UTC-7/-8), `"America/New_York"` (UTC-4/-5), `"Asia/Dubai"` (UTC+4), and `"Austrailia/Sydney"` (UTC+10/+11).

For any chosen `sessionInput` value, changing the `timezoneInput` value changes the specified session’s time zone. The script highlights *different bars* with each time zone choice because, unlike [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps), the *absolute* times that local hour and minute values correspond to *varies* across time zones:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-functions-Time-and-time-close-Testing-for-sessions-2.DKRpvO46_Z1pg5HR.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Testing session time zones demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The timeframe of the analyzed bars. 
string timeframeInput = input.timeframe("60", "Timeframe")
//@variable The session to check. Features four interval options. 
string sessionInput = input.session("1300-1700", "Session", ["0000-0400", "0930-1400", "1300-1700", "1700-2100"])
//@variable An IANA identifier representing the time zone of the `sessionInput`. Fetures four preset options. 
string timezoneInput = input.string("America/New_York", "Time zone", 
     ["America/Vancouver", "America/New_York", "Asia/Dubai", "Australia/Sydney"]
 )

//@variable Is `true` if a `timeframeInput` bar opens within the `sessionInput` session in the `timezoneInput` time zone.
//          The condition detects the session on different bars, depending on the chosesn time zone, because identical 
//          local times in different time zones refer to different absolute points in UNIX time.  
bool opensInSession = not na(time(timeframeInput, sessionInput, timezoneInput))

// Highlight the background when `opensInSession` is `true`. 
bgcolor(opensInSession ? color.rgb(33, 149, 243, 80) : na, title = "Open in session highlight")
```

Note that:

-   This script uses *IANA notation* for all [time zone strings](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) because it is the recommended format. Using an IANA identifier allows the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call to automatically adjust the session’s UTC offset based on a region’s local time policies, such as daylight saving time.

#### Testing for changes in higher timeframes

The `timeframe` parameter of the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions specifies the timeframe of the bars in the calculation, allowing scripts to retrieve opening/closing [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) from *higher timeframes* than the current chart’s timeframe without requiring `request.*()` function calls.

Programmers can use the opening/closing timestamps from higher-timeframe (HTF) bars to detect timeframe changes. One common approach is to call [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) or [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) with a consistent `timeframe` argument across all executions on a time-based chart and measure the one-bar change in the returned value with the [ta.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) function. The result is a *nonzero* value only when an HTF bar opens. One can also check whether the data has a time gap at that point by comparing the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) value to the previous bar’s [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) value. A gap is present when the opening timestamp on the current bar is greater than the closing timestamp on the previous bar.

The script below uses the call `time("1M")` to get the opening UNIX timestamp of the current bar on the “1M” timeframe, then assigns the result to the `currMonthlyOpenTime` variable. It detects when bars on that timeframe open by checking when the one-bar change in the `currMonthlyOpenTime` value is above zero. On each occurrence of the condition, the script detects whether the HTF bar opened after a gap by checking if the new opening timestamp is greater than the “1M” closing timestamp from the previous chart bar (`time_close("1M")[1]`).

The script draws [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) containing [formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) “1M” opening times to indicate the chart bars that mark the start of monthly bars. If a monthly bar opens without a gap from the previous closing time, the script draws a blue label. If a monthly bar starts after a gap, it draws a red label. Additionally, if the “1M” opening time does not match the opening time of the chart bar, the script displays that bar’s formatted time in the label for comparison:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-functions-Time-and-time-close-Testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes-1.EwKXV91R_16xSC0.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Detecting changes in higher timeframes demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The opening UNIX timestamp of the current bar on the "1M" timeframe.
int currMonthlyOpenTime = time("1M")
//@variable The closing timestamp on the "1M" timeframe as of the previous chart bar. 
int prevMonthlyCloseTime = time_close("1M")[1]

//@variable Is `true` when the opening time on the "1M" timeframe changes, indicating a new monthly bar. 
bool isNewTf = ta.change(currMonthlyOpenTime) > 0

if isNewTf
    // Initialize variables for the `text` and `color` properties of the label drawing.
    string lblText  = "New '1M' opening time:\n" + str.format_time(currMonthlyOpenTime)
    color  lblColor = color.blue

    //@variable Is `true` when the `currMonthlyOpenTime` exceeds the `prevMonthlyCloseTime`, indicating a time gap.
    bool hasGap = currMonthlyOpenTime > prevMonthlyCloseTime
    
    // Modify the `lblText` and `lblColor` based on the `hasGap` value.
    if hasGap
        lblText := "Gap from previous '1M' close.\n\n" + lblText
        lblColor := color.red
    // Include the formatted `time` value if the `currMonthlyOpenTime` is before the first available chart bar's `time`.
    if time > currMonthlyOpenTime
        lblText += "\nFirst chart bar has a later time:\n" + str.format_time(time)
    
    // Draw a `lblColor` label anchored to the `time` to display the `lblText`. 
    label.new(
         time, high, lblText, xloc.bar_time, color = lblColor, style = label.style_label_lower_right, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.large
     )
```

Note that:

-   Using [ta.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) on a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) or [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) call’s result is not the *only* way to detect changes in a higher timeframe. The [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change) function is an equivalent, more convenient option for scripts that do not need to *use* the UNIX timestamps from HTF bars in other calculations, as it returns a “bool” value directly without extra code.
-   The detected monthly opening times do not always correspond to the first calendar day of the month. Instead, they correspond to the first time assigned to a “1M” bar, which can be *after* the first calendar day. For symbols with overnight sessions, such as “USDJPY” in our example chart, a “1M” bar can also open *before* the first calendar day.
-   Sometimes, the opening time assigned to an HTF bar might *not* equal the opening time of any chart bar, which is why other conditions such as `time == time("1M")` cannot detect new monthly bars consistently. For example, on our “USDJPY” chart, the “1M” opening time `2023-12-31T17:00:00-0500` does not match an opening time on the “1D” timeframe. The first available “1D” bar after that point opened at `2024-01-01T17:00:00-0500`.

### Calendar-based functions

The [year()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_year), [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [weekofyear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_weekofyear), [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth), [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour), [minute()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_minute), and [second()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_second) functions calculate *calendar-based* “int” values from a [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps). Unlike the [calendar-based variables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#calendar-based-variables), which always hold exchange calendar values based on the current bar’s opening timestamp, these functions can return calendar values for any valid timestamp and express them in a chosen [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones).

Each of these calendar-based functions has the following two signatures:

```
functionName(time) → series intfunctionName(time, timezone) → series int
```

Where:

-   `functionName` is the function’s identifier.
-   The `time` parameter accepts an “int” UNIX timestamp for which the function calculates a corresponding calendar value.
-   The `timezone` parameter accepts a [time zone string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) specifying the returned value’s time zone. If the `timezone` argument is not specified, the function uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).

In contrast to the functions that return UNIX timestamps, a calendar-based function returns different “int” results for various time zones, as calendar values represent parts of a *local time* in a *specific region*.

For instance, the simple script below uses two calls to [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) to calculate each bar’s opening day in the exchange time zone and the “Australia/Sydney” time zone. It plots the results of the two calls in a separate pane for comparison:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-functions-Calendar-based-functions-1.7yz46qU5_56taF.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`dayofmonth()` demo", overlay = false)

//@variable An "int" representing the current bar's opening calendar day in the exchange time zone. 
//          Equivalent to the `dayofmonth` variable. 
int openingDay = dayofmonth(time)

//@variable An "int" representing the current bar's opening calendar day in the "Australia/Sydney" time zone.
int openingDaySydney = dayofmonth(time, "Australia/Sydney")

// Plot the calendar day values.
plot(openingDay,       "Day of Month (Exchange)", linewidth = 6, color = color.blue)
plot(openingDaySydney, "Day of Month (Sydney)",   linewidth = 3, color = color.orange)
```

Note that:

-   The first [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) call calculates the bar’s opening day in the exchange time zone because it does not include a `timezone` argument. This call returns the same value that the [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth) variable references.
-   Our example symbol’s exchange time zone is “America/New\_York”, which follows UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time (DST). The “Australia/Sydney” time zone follows UTC+10 during standard time and UTC+11 during DST. However, Sydney observes DST at *different* times of the year than New York. As such, its time zone is 14, 15, or 16 hours ahead of the exchange time zone, depending on the time of year. The plots on our “1D” chart diverge when the difference is at least 15 hours because the bars open at 09:30 in exchange time, and 15 hours ahead is 00:30 on the *next* calendar day.

It’s important to understand that although the `time` argument in a calendar-based function call represents a single, absolute point in time, each function returns only *part* of the date and time information available from the timestamp. Consequently, a calendar-based function’s returned value does **not** directly correspond to a *unique* time point, and conditions based on individual calendar values can apply to *multiple* bars.

For example, this script uses the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function to calculate a UNIX timestamp from a date “string”, and it calculates the calendar day from that timestamp, in the exchange time zone, with the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) function. The script compares each bar’s opening day to the calculated day and highlights the background when the two are equal:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Time-Time-functions-Calendar-based-functions-2.CLs3hZaQ_Z1mTUCj.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`dayofmonth()` demo", overlay = false)

//@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to August 29, 2024 at 00:00:00 UTC.
const int fixedTimestamp = timestamp("29 Aug 2024")
//@variable The day of the month calculated from the `fixedTimestamp`, expressed in the exchange time zone. 
//          If the exchange time zone has a negative UTC offset, this variable's value is 28 instead of 29.
int dayFromTimestamp = dayofmonth(fixedTimestamp)

//@variable An "int" representing the current bar's opening calendar day in the exchange time zone. 
//          Equivalent to the `dayofmonth` variable. 
int openingDay = dayofmonth(time)

// Plot the `openingDay`.
plot(openingDay, "Opening day of month", linewidth = 3)
// Highlight the background when the `openingDay` equals the `dayFromTimestamp`.
bgcolor(openingDay == dayFromTimestamp ? color.orange : na, title = "Day detected highlight")
```

Note that:

-   The [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call treats its argument as a *UTC* calendar date because its `dateString` argument does not specify time zone information. However, the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) call calculates the day in the *exchange time zone*. Our example symbol’s exchange time zone is “America/New\_York” (UTC-4/-5). Therefore, the returned value on this chart is 28 instead of 29.
-   The script highlights *any* bar on our chart that opens on the 28th day of *any* month instead of only a specific bar because the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) function’s returned value does **not** represent a specific point in time on its own.
-   This script highlights the bars that *open* on the day of the month calculated from the timestamp. However, some months on our chart have no trading activity on that day. For example, the script does not highlight when the July 28, 2024 occurs on our chart because NASDAQ is closed on Sundays.

Similar to [calendar-based variables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#calendar-based-variables), these functions are also helpful when testing for dates/times and detecting calendar changes on the chart. The example below uses the [year()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_year), [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [weekofyear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_weekofyear), and [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek) functions on the [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) timestamp to create conditions that test if the current bar is the first bar that closes in a new year, quarter, month, week, and day. The script [plots shapes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/text-and-shapes/#plotshape), draws [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels), and uses [background colors](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/backgrounds/) to visualize the conditions on the chart:

Note that:

-   This script’s conditions check for the first bar that closes after each calendar unit changes its value. The bar where each condition is `true` varies with the data available on the chart. For example, the `closeInNewMonth` condition can be `true` *after* the first calendar day of the month if a chart bar did not close on that day.
-   To detect when new bars start on a specific *timeframe* rather than strictly calendar changes, check when the [ta.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) of a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) or [time\_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) call’s returned value is nonzero, or use the [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change) function. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) above for more information.

### ​timestamp()​

The [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function calculates a [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) from a specified calendar date and time. It has the following three signatures:

```
timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → simple/series inttimestamp(timezone, year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → simple/series inttimestamp(dateString) → const int
```

The first two signatures listed include `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second` parameters that accept “int” values defining the calendar date and time. A [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call with either signature must include `year`, `month`, and `day` arguments. The other parameters are optional, each with a default value of 0. Both signatures can return either *“simple”* or *“series”* values, depending on the [qualified types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#qualifiers) of the specified arguments.

The primary difference between the first two signatures is the `timezone` parameter, which accepts a [time zone string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) that determines the [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones) of the *date and time* specified by the other parameters. If a [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call with “int” calendar arguments does not include a `timezone` argument, it uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)) by default.

The third signature listed has only *one* parameter, `dateString`, which accepts a “string” representing a valid calendar date (e.g., `"20 Aug 2024"`). The value can also include the time of day and time zone (e.g., `"20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 UTC+0"`). If the `dateString` argument does not specify the time of day, the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call considers the time 00:00 (midnight).

Unlike the other two signatures, the default time zone for the third signature is **GMT+0**. It does **not** use the exchange time zone by default because it interprets time zone information from the `dateString` directly. Additionally, the third signature is the only one that returns a *“const int”* value. As shown in the [Time input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/#time-input) section of the [Inputs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/) page, programmers can use this overload’s returned value as the `defval` argument in an [input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time) function call.

When using the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function, it’s crucial to understand how time zone information affects its calculations. The *absolute* point in time represented by a specific calendar date *depends* on its time zone, as an identical date and time in various time zones can refer to **different** amounts of time elapsed since the *UNIX Epoch*. Therefore, changing the time zone of the calendar date and time in a [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call *can change* its returned [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps).

The following script compares the results of four different [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) calls that evaluate the date 2021-01-01 in different time zones. The first [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call does not specify time zone information in its `dateString` argument, so it treats the value as a *UTC* calendar date. The fourth call also evaluates the calendar date in UTC because it includes `"UTC0"` as the `timezone` argument. The second [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call uses the first signature listed above, meaning it uses the exchange time zone, and the third call uses the second signature with `"America/New_York"` as the `timezone` argument.

The script draws a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) with rows displaying each [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call, its assigned variable, the calculated UNIX timestamp, and a [formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) representation of the time. As we see on the “NASDAQ:MSFT” chart below, the first and fourth table rows show *different* timestamps than the second and third, leading to different formatted strings in the last column:

```

Note that:

-   The [formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) date-time strings express results in the exchange time zone because the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function uses [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) as the default `timezone` argument. The formatted values on our example chart show the offset string `"-0500"` because NASDAQ’s time zone (“America/New\_York”) follows UTC-5 during *standard time*.
-   The formatted strings on the first and fourth rows show the date and time five hours *before* January 1, 2021, because the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) calls evaluated the date in *UTC* and the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) calls used a time zone five hours *behind* UTC.
-   On our chart, the second and third rows have matching timestamps because both corresponding [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) calls evaluated the date in the “America/New\_York” time zone. The two rows would show different results if we applied the script to a symbol with a different exchange time zone.

## Formatting dates and times

Programmers can format [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) into human-readable dates and times, expressed in specific [time zones](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones), using the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function. The function has the following signature:

```
str.format_time(time, format, timezone) → series string
```

Where:

-   The `time` parameter specifies the “int” UNIX timestamp to express as a readable time.
-   The `format` parameter accepts a “string” consisting of *formatting tokens* that determine the returned information. If the function call does not include a `format` argument, it uses the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard format: `"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ"`. See the table below for a list of valid tokens and the information they represent.
-   The `timezone` parameter determines the time zone of the formatted result. It accepts a [time zone string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zone-strings) in UTC or IANA notation. If the call does not specify a `timezone`, it uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).

The general-purpose [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format) function can also format UNIX timestamps into readable dates and times. However, the function **cannot** express time information in *different* time zones. It always expresses dates and times in **UTC+0**. In turn, using this function to format timestamps often results in *erroneous* practices, such as mathematically modifying a timestamp to try and represent the time in another time zone. However, a UNIX timestamp is a unique, **time zone-agnostic** representation of a specific point in time. As such, modifying a UNIX timestamp changes the *absolute time* it represents rather than expressing the same time in a different time zone.

The [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function does not have this limitation, as it can calculate dates and times in *any* time zone correctly without changing the meaning of a UNIX timestamp. In addition, unlike [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format), it is optimized specifically for processing time values. Therefore, we recommend that programmers use [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) instead of [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format) to format UNIX timestamps into readable dates and times.

A [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) call’s `format` argument determines the time information its returned value contains. The function treats characters and sequences in the argument as *formatting tokens*, which act as *placeholders* for values in the returned date/time “string”. The following table outlines the most commonly used formatting tokens and explains what each represents:

Token

Represents

Remarks and examples

`"y"`

Year

Use `"yy"` to include the last two digits of the year (e.g., `"00"`), or `"yyyy"` to include the complete year number (e.g., `"2000"`).

`"M"`

Month

Uppercase `"M"` for the month, not to be confused with *lowercase* `"m"` for the minute.  
Use `"MM"` to include the two-digit month number with a leading zero for single-digit values (e.g., `"01"`), `"MMM"` to include the three-letter abbreviation of month (e.g., `"Jan"`), or `"MMMM"` for the full month name (e.g., `"January"`).

`"d"`

Day of the **month**

Lowercase `"d"`.  
Includes the numeric day of the month (`"1"` to `"31"`).  
Use `"dd"` for the two-digit day number with a leading zero for single-digit values.  
It is *not* a placeholder for the day number of the *week* (1-7). Use [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek) to calculate that value.

`"D"`

Day of the **year**

Uppercase `"D"`.  
Includes the numeric day of the year (`"1"` to `"366"`).  
Use `"DD"` or `"DDD"` for the two-digit or three-digit day number with leading zeros.

`"E"`

Day of the **week**

Includes the abbreviation of the weekday *name* (e.g., `"Mon"`).  
Use `"EEEE"` for the weekday’s full name (e.g., `"Monday"`)

`"w"`

Week of the **year**

Lowercase `"w"`.  
Includes the week number of the year (`"1"` to `"53"`).  
Use `"ww"` for the two-digit week number with a leading zero for single-digit values.

`"W"`

Week of the **month**

Uppercase `"W"`.  
Includes the week number of the month (`"1"` to `"5"`).

`"a"`

AM/PM postfix

Lowercase `"a"`.  
Includes `"AM"` if the time of day is before noon, `"PM"` otherwise.

`"h"`

Hour in the **12-hour** format

Lowercase `"h"`.  
The included hour number from this token ranges from `"0"` to `"11"`.  
Use `"hh"` for the two-digit hour with a leading zero for single-digit values.

`"H"`

Hour in the **24-hour** format

Uppercase `"H"`.  
The included hour number from this token ranges from `"0"` to `"23"`.  
Use `"HH"` for the two-digit hour with a leading zero for single-digit values.

`"m"`

Minute

Lowercase `"m"` for the minute, not to be confused with *uppercase* `"M"` for the month.  
Use `"mm"` for the two-digit minute with a leading zero for single-digit values.

`"s"`

Second

Lowercase `"s"` for the second, not to be confused with *uppercase* `"S"` for fractions of a second.  
Use `"ss"` for the two-digit second with a leading zero for single-digit values.

`"S"`

Fractions of a second

Uppercase `"S"`.  
Includes the number of milliseconds in the fractional second (`"0"` to `"999"`).  
Use `"SS"` or `"SSS"` for the two-digit or three-digit millisecond number with leading zeros.

`"Z"`

Time zone (**UTC offset**)

Uppercase `"Z"`.  
Includes the hour and minute UTC offset value in `"HHmm"` format, preceded by its sign (e.g., `"-0400"`).

`"z"`

Time zone (**abbreviation or name**)

Lowercase `"z"`.  
A single `"z"` includes the abbreviation of the time zone (e.g., `"EDT"`).  
Use `"zzzz"` for the time zone’s name (e.g., `"Eastern Daylight Time"`).  
It is not a placeholder for the *IANA identifier*. Use [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) to retrieve the exchange time zone’s IANA representation.

`":"`, `"/"`, `"-"`, `"."`, `","`, `"("`, `")"`, `" "`

Separators

These characters are separators for formatting tokens.  
They appear as they are in the formatted text. (e.g., `"01/01/24"`, `"12:30:00"`, `"Jan 1, 2024"`).  
Some other characters can also act as separators. However, the ones listed are the most common.

`"'"`

Escape character

Characters enclosed within *two single quotes* appear as they are in the result, even if they otherwise act as formatting tokens. For example, `" 'Day' "` appears as-is in the resulting “string” instead of listing the day of the year, AM/PM postfix, and year.

The following example demonstrates how various formatting tokens affect the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function’s result. The script calls the function with different `format` arguments to create date/time strings from [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time), [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow), and [time\_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) timestamps. It displays each `format` value and the corresponding formatted result in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the last bar:

## Expressing time differences

Every [UNIX timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps) represents a specific point in time as the absolute *time difference* from a fixed historical point (epoch). The specific epoch all UNIX timestamps reference is *midnight UTC on January 1, 1970*. Programmers can [format](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) UNIX timestamps into readable date-time strings with the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function because it uses the time difference from the UNIX Epoch in its date and time calculations.

In contrast, the difference between two nonzero UNIX timestamps represents the number of milliseconds elapsed from one absolute point to another. The difference does not directly refer to a specific point in UNIX time if neither timestamp in the operation has a value of 0 (corresponding to the UNIX Epoch).

Programmers may want to express the millisecond difference between two UNIX timestamps in *other time units*, such as seconds, days, etc. Some might assume they can use the difference as the `time` argument in a [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) call to achieve this result. However, the function always treats its `time` argument as the time elapsed from the *UNIX Epoch* to derive a *calendar date/time* representation in a specific [time zone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#time-zones). It **does not** express time differences directly. Therefore, attempting to format timestamp *differences* rather than timestamps with [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) leads to unintended results.

For example, the following script calculates the millisecond difference between the current execution time ([timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow)) and the “1M” bar’s closing time (`time_close("1M")`) for a monthly countdown timer display. It attempts to express the time difference in another format using [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time). It displays the function call’s result in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table), along with the original millisecond difference (`timeLeft`) and [formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) date-time representations of the timestamps.

As we see below, the table shows correct results for the formatted timestamps and the `timeLeft` value. However, the formatted time difference appears as `"1970-01-12T16:47:10-0500"`. Although the `timeLeft` value is supposed to represent a difference between timestamps rather than a specific point in time, the [str.format\_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function still treats the value as a **UNIX timestamp**. Consequently, it creates a “string” expressing the value as a *date and time* in the UTC-5 time zone:

     )

     )
```

To express the difference between timestamps in other time units correctly, programmers must write code that *calculates* the number of units elapsed instead of erroneously formatting the difference as a specific date or time.

The calculations required to express time differences depend on the chosen time units. The sections below explain how to express millisecond differences in [weekly and smaller units](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#weekly-and-smaller-units), and [monthly and larger units](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#monthly-and-larger-units).

### Weekly and smaller units

Weeks and smaller time units (days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) cover *consistent* blocks of time. These units have the following relationship:

-   One week equals seven days.
-   One day equals 24 hours.
-   One hour equals 60 minutes.
-   One minute equals 60 seconds.
-   One second equals 1000 milliseconds.

Using this relationship, programmers can define the span of these units by the number of *milliseconds* they contain. For example, since every hour has 60 minutes, every minute has 60 seconds, and every second has 1000 milliseconds, the number of milliseconds per hour is `60 * 60 * 1000`, which equals `3600000`.

Programmers can use *modular arithmetic* based on the milliseconds in each unit to calculate the total number of weeks, days, and smaller spans covered by the difference between two [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps). The process is as follows, starting from the *largest* time unit in the calculation:

1.  Calculate the number of milliseconds in the time unit.
2.  Divide the remaining millisecond difference by the calculated value and round down to the nearest whole number. The result represents the number of *complete* time units within the interval.
3.  Use the *remainder* from the division as the new remaining millisecond difference.
4.  Repeat steps 1-3 for each time unit in the calculation, in *descending* order based on size.

The following script implements this process in a custom `formatTimeSpan()` function. The function accepts two UNIX timestamps defining a start and end point, and its “bool” parameters control whether it calculates the number of weeks or smaller units covered by the time range. The function calculates the millisecond distance between the two timestamps. It then calculates the numbers of complete units covered by that distance and formats the results into a “string”.

The script calls `formatTimeSpan()` to express the difference between two separate [time input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/#time-input) values in selected time units. It then displays the resulting “string” in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) alongside [formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#formatting-dates-and-times) representations of the start and end times:

```

Note that:

-   The [user-defined function](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/) uses [math.floor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.floor) to round each divided result down to the nearest “int” value to get the number of *complete* units in the interval. After division, it uses the modulo assignment operator ([%=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%25=)) to get the *remainder* and assign that value to the `timeDifference` variable. This process repeats for each selected unit.

The image above shows the calculated time difference in mixed time units. By toggling the “bool” inputs, users can also isolate specific units in the calculation. For example, this image shows the result after enabling only the “Milliseconds” input:

### Monthly and larger units

Unlike weeks and smaller units, months and larger units *vary* in length based on calendar rules. For example, a month can contain 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, and a year can contain 365 or 366 days.

Some programmers prefer to use the modular arithmetic outlined in the [previous section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#weekly-and-smaller-units), with *approximate lengths* for these irregular units, to calculate large-unit durations between [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#unix-timestamps). With this process, programmers usually define the units in either of the following ways:

-   Using *common* lengths, e.g., a common year equals 365 days, and a common month equals 30 days.
-   Using the *average* lengths, e.g., an average year equals 365.25 days, and an average month equals 30.4375 days.

Calculations involving approximate units produce *rough estimates* of the elapsed time. Such estimates are often practical when expressing relatively short durations. However, their precision diminishes with the size of the difference, drifting further away from the actual time elapsed.

Therefore, expressing time differences in monthly and larger units with precision requires a different calculation than the process outlined above. For a more precise estimate of months, years, and larger units elapsed, the calculations should use the *actual* span of each individual unit rather than approximations, meaning it must account for *leap years* and *variations* in month sizes.

The advanced example below contains a custom `formatTimeDifference()` function that calculates the years and months, in addition to days and smaller units, elapsed between two UNIX timestamps.

The function uses the process outlined in the [previous section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/time/#weekly-and-smaller-units) to calculate the daily and smaller units within the interval. For the monthly and yearly units, which have *irregular* lengths, the function uses a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#while-loops) loop to iterate across calendar months. On each iteration, it increments monthly and yearly counters and subtracts the number of days in the added month from the day counter. After the loop ends, the function adjusts the year, month, and day counters to account for partial months elapsed between the timestamps. Finally, it uses the counters in a [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format) call to create a formatted “string” containing the calculated values.

The script calls this `formatTimeDifference()` function to calculate the years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds elapsed between two separate [time input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs/#time-input) values and displays the result in a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label):

Note that:

-   The script determines the number of days in each month with the user-defined `daysPerMonth()` function. The function identifies whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days based on its month number and the year it belongs to. Its calculation accounts for leap years. A leap year occurs when the year is divisible by 4 or 400 but not by 100.
-   Before the [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#while-loops) loop, the function subtracts the number of days in a partial starting month from the initial day count, aligning the counters with the beginning of a new month. It re-adds the subtracted days after the loop to adjust the counters for partial months. It adjusts the month and year counters based on the days in the `startMonth` if the `startDay` is less than halfway through that month. Otherwise, it adjusts the values based on the days in the `endMonth`.
