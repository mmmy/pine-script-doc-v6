# Bar states

## Introduction

A set of built-in variables in the `barstate` namespace allow your script to detect different properties of the bar on which the script is currently executing.

These states can be used to restrict the execution or the logic of your code to specific bars.

Some built-ins return information on the trading session the current bar belongs to. They are explained in the [Session states](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/sessions/#session-variables-reference) section.

## Bar state built-in variables

Note that while indicators and libraries run on all price or volume updates in real time, strategies not using `calc_on_every_tick` will not; they will only execute when the realtime bar closes. This will affect the detection of bar states in that type of script. On open markets, for example, this code will not display a background until the realtime closes because that is when the strategy runs:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
strategy("S")
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? color.silver : na)
```

### ​barstate.isfirst​

[barstate.isfirst](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disfirst) is only `true` on the dataset’s first bar, i.e., when [bar\_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) is zero.

It can be useful to initialize variables on the first bar only, e.g.:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
FILL_COLOR = color.green
var fillColors = array.new<color>(0)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill color.
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))
```

### ​barstate.islast​

[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast) is `true` if the current bar is the last one on the chart, whether that bar is a realtime bar or not.

It can be used to restrict the execution of code to the chart’s last bar, which is often useful when drawing lines, labels or tables. Here, we use it to determine when to update a label which we want to appear only on the last bar. We create the label only once and then update its properties using `label.set_*()` functions because it is more efficient:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
// Create label on the first bar only.
var label hiLabel = label.new(na, na, "")
// Update the label's position and text on the last bar,
// including on all realtime bar updates.
if barstate.islast
    label.set_xy(hiLabel, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(hiLabel, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
```

### ​barstate.ishistory​

[barstate.ishistory](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dishistory) is `true` on all historical bars. It can never be `true` on a bar when [barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disrealtime) is also `true`, and it does not become `true` on a realtime bar’s closing update, when [barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed) becomes `true`. On closed markets, it can be `true` on the same bar where [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast) is also `true`.

### ​barstate.isrealtime​

[barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disrealtime) is `true` if the current data update is a real-time bar update, `false` otherwise (thus it is historical). Note that [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast) is also `true` on all realtime bars.

### ​barstate.isnew​

[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew) is `true` on all historical bars and on the realtime bar’s first (opening) update.

All historical bars are considered *new* bars because the Pine Script® runtime executes your script on each bar sequentially, from the chart’s first bar in time, to the last. Each historical bar is thus *discovered* by your script as it executes, bar to bar.

[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew) can be useful to reset [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) variables when a new realtime bar comes in. The following code will reset `updateNo` to 1 on all historical bars and at the beginning of each realtime bar. It calculates the number of realtime updates during each realtime bar:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("")
updateNo() => 
    varip int updateNo = na
    if barstate.isnew
        updateNo := 1
    else
        updateNo += 1
plot(updateNo())
```

### ​barstate.isconfirmed​

[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed) is `true` on all historical bars and on the last (closing) update of a realtime bar.

It can be useful to avoid repainting by requiring the realtime bar to be closed before a condition can become `true`. We use it here to hold plotting of our RSI until the realtime bar closes and becomes an elapsed realtime bar. It will plot on historical bars because [barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed) is always `true` on them:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
plot(barstate.isconfirmed ? myRSI : na)
```

[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed) will not work when used in a [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity) call.

### ​barstate.islastconfirmedhistory​

[barstate.islastconfirmedhistory](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislastconfirmedhistory) is `true` if the script is executing on the dataset’s last bar when the market is closed, or on the bar immediately preceding the realtime bar if the market is open.

It can be used to detect the first realtime bar with `barstate.islastconfirmedhistory[1]`, or to postpone server-intensive calculations until the last historical bar, which would otherwise be undetectable on open markets.

## Example

Here is an example of a script using `barstate.*` variables:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Bar States", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

stateText() =>
    string txt = ""
    txt += barstate.isfirst     ? "isfirst\n"     : ""
    txt += barstate.islast      ? "islast\n"      : ""
    txt += barstate.ishistory   ? "ishistory\n"   : ""
    txt += barstate.isrealtime  ? "isrealtime\n"  : ""
    txt += barstate.isnew       ? "isnew\n"       : ""
    txt += barstate.isconfirmed ? "isconfirmed\n" : ""
    txt += barstate.islastconfirmedhistory ? "islastconfirmedhistory\n" : ""

labelColor = switch
    barstate.isfirst                => color.fuchsia
    barstate.islastconfirmedhistory => color.gray
    barstate.ishistory              => color.silver
    barstate.isconfirmed            => color.orange
    barstate.isnew                  => color.red
    => color.yellow

label.new(bar_index, na, stateText(), yloc = yloc.abovebar, color = labelColor)
```

Note that:

-   Each state’s name will appear in the label’s text when it is `true`.
-   There are five possible colors for the label’s background:
    -   fuchsia on the first bar
    -   silver on historical bars
    -   gray on the last confirmed historical bar
    -   orange when a realtime bar is confirmed (when it closes and becomes an elapsed realtime bar)
    -   red on the realtime bar’s first execution
    -   yellow for other executions of the realtime bar

We begin by adding the indicator to the chart of an open market, but before any realtime update is received. Note how the last confirmed history bar is identified in #1, and how the last bar is identified as the last one, but is still considered a historical bar because no realtime updates have been received.

Let’s look at what happens when realtime updates start coming in:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/BarStates-Example-02.B_WDB0Io_Z2snO6O.webp)

Note that:

-   The realtime bar is red because it is its first execution, because `barstate.isnew` is `true` and `barstate.ishistory` is no longer `true`, so our [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch) structure determing our color uses the `barstate.isnew => color.red` branch. This will usually not last long because on the next update `barstate.isnew` will no longer be `true` so the label’s color will turn yellow.
-   The label of elapsed realtime bars is orange because those bars were not historical bars when they closed. Accordingly, the `barstate.ishistory => color.silver` branch in the [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch) structure was not executed, but the next one, `barstate.isconfirmed => color.orange` was.

This last example shows how the realtime bar’s label will turn yellow after the first execution on the bar. This is the way the label will usually appear on realtime bars:
