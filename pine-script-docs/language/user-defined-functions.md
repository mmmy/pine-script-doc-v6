# User-defined functions

## Introduction

*User-defined functions* are functions written by programmers, as opposed to the [built-in functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/built-ins/#built-in-functions) provided by Pine Script®. They help to encapsulate custom calculations that scripts perform conditionally or repeatedly, or to isolate logic in a single location for modularity and readability. Programmers often write functions to extend the capabilities of their scripts when no existing built-ins fit their needs.

A function definition consists of two main parts: a *header* and a *body*.

**Header**

The header declares the function’s *signature*, i.e., its *name* and *parameters*. A script *calls* the function by creating an expression containing the function’s name followed by parentheses (e.g., `f()`). If the function has declared parameters, calls to the function list *arguments* (values or references) for those parameters within the parentheses (e.g., `f(x = 1)`).

**Body**

The function’s body is the code that follows the header. Each *call* to the function performs the tasks defined by the expressions and statements in the function’s body.

Function definitions in Pine can use either of the following formats:

-   [Single-line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#single-line-functions) format, where the function’s header and body occupy only *one* line of code. This format is best suited for defining compact functions containing only minimal statements or expressions.
-   [Multiline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#multiline-functions) format, where the *first* line defines the function’s header, and all *indented* lines that follow define the function’s body. This format is optimal for functions that require [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/), [loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/), or multiple other statements.

Programmers can define functions for use only in a specific script, or create *library functions* for use in other scripts. Refer to our [Style guide](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/style-guide/) for recommendations on where to include function definitions in a source code. To learn more about library functions and their unique requirements, see the [Libraries](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/libraries/) page.

Regardless of format, location, or use, several common characteristics and [limitations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#limitations) apply to every user-defined function, including the following:

-   The function’s definition must be in the [global scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/programming/#what-does-scope-mean). Programmers cannot define functions inside the body of another function or the local blocks of any other structure.
-   The function cannot modify its declared parameters or any global variables.
-   The function can include calls to most other functions within its body, but it *cannot* include calls to *itself* or to functions that must be called from the *global scope*.
-   Each written call to the function must have consistent parameter [types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#types), and therefore consistent *argument* types, across all executions.
-   Each call returns the result of evaluating the *final* statement or separate expression defined in the function’s body, and that result inherits the *strongest* [type qualifier](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#qualifiers) used in the call’s calculations. As with parameter types, the call’s returned types must be consistent across executions.
-   Each written call to the function establishes a *new scope* from the function’s definition. The parameters, variables, and expressions created in that scope are *unique* and have an *independent* history; other calls to the function do not directly affect them.

## Structure and syntax

A function definition can occupy a single line of code or multiple lines, depending on the expressions and statements that the function requires. The single-line and multiline formats are similar, with the key difference being the placement of the function’s *body*.

Single-line functions define their header and body on the same line of code:

```
<functionHeader> => <functionBody>
```

In contrast, multiline functions define the body on separate lines of code following the header. The code block following the header line has an indentation of *four spaces* or a single tab:

```
<functionHeader> =>    <functionBody>
```

Both formats use the following syntax for defining the function’s *header*:

```
[export ]<functionName>([[[paramQualifier ]<paramType> ]<paramName>[ = defaultValue], …]) =>
```

Where:

-   All parts within square brackets (`[]`) represent *optional* syntax, and all parts within angle brackets (`<>`) represent *required* syntax.
-   [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export) is the optional keyword for exporting the function from a library, enabling its use in other scripts. See the [Libraries](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/libraries/) page to learn more.
-   `functionName` is the function’s identifier (name). The script calls the function by referencing this identifier, followed by parentheses.
-   `paramName` is the identifier for a declared *parameter*. The script can supply a specific *argument* (value or reference) to the parameter in each function call. A function header can contain zero or more parameter declarations.
-   `defaultValue` is the parameter’s default argument. If not specified, each call to the function requires an argument for the parameter. Otherwise, supplying an argument is optional.
-   `paramQualifier` and `paramType` are qualifier and type *keywords*, which together specify the parameter’s [qualified type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/). Using these keywords is optional in most cases. If the declaration does not include them, the compiler determines the parameter’s type information automatically. See the [Declaring parameter types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#declaring-parameter-types) section to learn more.

TipProgrammers can also place the [method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_method) keyword immediately before a function’s name to declare the function as a *method* for a *specific type*. All methods must include at least *one* parameter, and the first parameter *requires* a declared type. Refer to the [Methods](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/) page for more information.

Below is an example of a simple function header. The header declares that the function’s name is `myFunction`, and that the function has two parameters named `param1` and `param2`:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
myFunction(param1, param2) =>
```

Note that:

-   Neither parameter has a *default* argument. Therefore, the script must supply arguments to these parameters in *every* `myFunction()` call.
-   Because the function’s parameters do not include [type keywords](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#type-keywords), they inherit the *same* qualified type as their argument in each separate call.

The following two sections explain the body structure of single-line and multiline functions.

### Single-line functions

A single-line function’s body begins and ends on the *same* line of code as the header. This format is convenient for defining compact functions that execute only simple statements and do not use [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/) or [loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/). The syntax to define a single-line function is as follows:

```
<functionHeader> => {statement, }<returnExpression>
```

Where:

-   `functionHeader` declares the function’s *name* and *parameters*, as explained in the [previous section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#structure-and-syntax).
-   `statement`, in curly brackets, represents zero or more statements or expressions that the function evaluates *before* returning a result. The function must separate all individual statements in its body with *commas*.
-   `returnExpression` is the *final* expression, variable, or [tuple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#tuples) in the function’s body. Each function call *returns* the result of evaluating this code.

The following example defines an `add()` function in single-line format. The function includes two parameters named `val1` and `val2`. The body of the function contains a single [+](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_+) operation that *adds* or [concatenates](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strings/#concatenation) the parameter values, depending on their [types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#types). Each call to the function returns the result of that operation:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
add(val1, val2) => val1 + val2
```

A script that includes this function definition can call `add()` with different arguments for `val1` and `val2`. The type of value returned by each call depends on these arguments. For example, the script below executes a few calls to `add()`, then passes their results to the `series`, `title`, and `linewidth` parameters in a call to [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot):

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Structure-and-syntax-Single-line-functions-1.ZUSKhP6e_ZKc48j.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Simple single-line function demo")

add(val1, val2) => val1 + val2

float  a = add(open, close)              // `open + close`  ("series float")
int    b = add(bar_index, 1)             // `bar_index + 1` ("series int")
int    c = add(2, 3)                     //  5              ("const int")
string d = add(add("Test", " "), "plot") // `"Test plot"`   ("const string")

// Create a plot using the `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` values.
plot(a / b, title = d, linewidth = c)
```

Note that:

-   The `val1` and `val2` parameters automatically *inherit* the qualified types of their arguments in each `add()` call, because the function’s header does not [declare their types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#declaring-parameter-types) using type and qualifier keywords.
-   Although the parameters accept arguments of any type, except for [void](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#void), an `add()` function call compiles successfully only if the arguments have types that are *compatible* with the [+](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_+) operator, such as “int”, “float”, or “string”. As shown above, if the arguments are numbers (“int” or “float” values), the function performs *addition*. If they are strings, the function performs *concatenation*.
-   The value returned by each `add()` call inherits the *strongest* [type qualifier](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#qualifiers) used in the calculation. The first two calls return “series” results because both use at least one “series” value. In contrast, the other calls return “const” results, because all values in their calculations are *constants*.

The body of a single-line function can contain a *comma-separated list* of statements and expressions. Each call to the function evaluates the list from left to right, treating each item as a separate line of code. The call returns the result of evaluating the *final* expression or statement in the list.

For example, the following script contains a `zScore()` function defined in single-line format. The function computes the [z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) of a `source` series over `length` bars. Its body declares two variables, `mean` and `sd`, to hold the average and standard deviation of the series. The final expression in the body uses these variables to calculate the function’s returned value. On each bar, the script calls the `zScore()` function using [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) as the `source` argument and 20 as the `length` argument, then plots the result:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Structure-and-syntax-Single-line-functions-2.BetlAr8S_1ryqEl.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Single-line function with more than one statement demo")

//@function Calculates the z-score of a `source` series over `length` bars.
zScore(float source, int length) => mean = ta.sma(source, length), sd = ta.stdev(source, length), (source - mean) / sd

//@variable The 20-bar z-score of `close` values.
float osc = zScore(close, 20)

// Plot the `osc` series as color-coded columns.
plot(osc, "Z-score", osc > 0 ? color.green : color.red, style = plot.style_columns)
```

Note that:

-   The `source` parameter requires an “int” or “float” value because its declaration includes the [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float) keyword. The `length` parameter requires an “int” value because its declaration uses the [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int) keyword. See the [Declaring parameter types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#declaring-parameter-types) section to learn more.
-   The `//@variable` and `//@function` comments are [annotations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#compiler-annotations) that document identifiers in the code. The `//@function` annotation provides documentation for the `zScore()` function. Users can hover over the function’s name in the Pine Editor, or write a function call, to view the annotation’s formatted text in a pop-up window. See the [Documenting functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#documenting-functions) section for more information.

TipAlthough it is possible to write single-line functions containing multiple statements, as shown above, using the [multiline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#multiline-functions) format is often preferred for readability. Programmers can list the statements on separate lines and add comments for each one.

### Multiline functions

A multiline function defines its body using a *block* of code following the header line. The general syntax is as follows:

```
<functionHeader> =>    [statements]    …    <returnExpression>
```

Where:

-   `functionHeader` declares the function’s *name* and *parameters*. See the [Structure and syntax](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#structure-and-syntax) section above to learn the syntax for function headers.
-   `statements` is an optional block of statements and expressions that the function evaluates *before* returning a result. Single lines in the body can also contain *multiple* statements separated by commas.
-   `returnExpression` is the *final* statement, expression, variable, or tuple at the end of the body. Each call to the function returns the result of this code. If the end of the function’s body is a comma-separated list of statements or expressions, `returnExpression` is the code at the end of that list. If the final statement is a [conditional structure](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/) or [loop](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/), the function returns that structure’s result.
-   Each line of code following the function’s header has an indentation of *four spaces* or a tab, signifying that it belongs to the function’s scope. The function’s body ends on the final indented line; all non-indented code following the definition belongs to the *global* scope.

The multiline format is well-suited for defining functions that perform multiple tasks. Programmers can organize all the function’s statements across different lines and document them with comments for readability.

In the following example, we modified the second script from the [Single-line functions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#single-line-functions) section to define an equivalent `zScore()` function using the multiline format. The function’s [variable declarations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/) and return expression are now on *separate* indented lines, and we’ve added comments inside the body to describe the function’s calculations:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Multiline function demo")

//@function Calculates the z-score of a `source` series over `length` bars.
zScore(float source, int length) =>
    // Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the series.
    float mean = ta.sma(source, length)
    float sd   = ta.stdev(source, length)
    // Compute the z-score using the `mean` and `sd` values, and return the result.
    (source - mean) / sd

//@variable The 20-bar z-score of `close` values.
float osc = zScore(close, 20)

// Plot the `osc` series as color-coded columns.
plot(osc, "Z-score", osc > 0 ? color.green : color.red, style = plot.style_columns)
```

Note that:

-   We added the [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float) keyword to the `mean` and `sd` declarations to declare their [types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#types) in the code. The keyword is *optional* in both variable declarations because the compiler can determine the correct types from the assigned values, but including it helps promote readability.

Programmers often define multiline functions to encapsulate complex or logical tasks involving [loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/) or [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/). If the final part of a function’s body contains one of these structures, a call to the function returns the result of evaluating that structure.

For example, the `smoothMedian()` function in the script below calculates the median of a `source` series over `length` bars, then smooths the result using a moving average specified by the `avgType` parameter. The function compares the `avgType` value in a [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch) statement to select the type of average that it returns. The script calls the function to calculate the median of [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values over 10 bars, smoothed by an [EMA](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592270-exponential-moving-average/) with the same length, and then plots the result on the chart:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Structure-and-syntax-Multiline-functions-1.BxkB4CE1_Zoo4No.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Multiline function with conditional structure demo", overlay = true, behind_chart = false)

//@function Calculates the median of `source` over `length` bars, then returns a moving average of the median.
smoothMedian(float source, int length, string avgType = "ema") =>

    //@variable The median of the `source` series.
    float median = ta.median(source, length)

    // Calculate the EMA, SMA, and WMA of `median`.
    float ema = ta.ema(median, length)
    float sma = ta.sma(median, length)
    float wma = ta.wma(median, length)

    // Return `ema`, `sma`, or `wma`, depending on the `avgType` value.
    switch avgType
        "ema" => ema
        "sma" => sma
        "wma" => wma

//@variable The EMA of the 10-bar median of `close` values.
float medSmooth = smoothMedian(close, 10)

// Plot the `medSmooth` series as a color-coded line.
plot(medSmooth, "Smoothed median", close > medSmooth ? color.teal : color.maroon, 3)
```

Note that:

-   The `smoothMedian()` call in this example does not supply an argument to the `avgType` parameter. Specifying an argument is *optional*, because the parameter declaration includes a *default argument* (`"ema"`).
-   We included empty lines between each section for readability. The lines that follow an empty line are considered part of the function as long as they are indented correctly.

## Functions that return multiple results

Sometimes, a function must perform multiple calculations and return separate results for each one. Programmers can write functions that return *multiple* values or references by using a [tuple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#tuples) as the *final statement* in the function’s body. A tuple is a comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in square brackets (`[]`). Every call to a function with a tuple at the end of its body returns the result of evaluating each listed expression in order.

For example, the `sumDiff()` function below calculates both the sum and difference of the values passed to its `val1` and `val2` parameters. Its body consists of a two-item tuple containing the addition and subtraction [operations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function Returns a tuple containing the sum and difference between the `val1` and `val2` values, respectively.
sumDiff(float val1, float val2) =>
    [val1 + val2, val1 - val2]
```

Note that:

-   The `val1` and `val2` parameters include the [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float) keyword in their declarations. Therefore, both parameters are of the type “float”, and they accept only “float” or “int” arguments. See the [Declaring parameter types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#declaring-parameter-types) section for more information.

Because the end of the function’s body is a two-item tuple, each call to the function always returns two separate values. To assign the function’s results to variables, the script must use a [tuple declaration](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#tuple-declarations) containing one *new* variable for each returned item. It is *not* possible to reassign existing tuples or to use previously declared variables within them.

The following example calls `sumDiff()` to calculate the sum and difference between two pseudorandom values. The script uses a tuple declaration containing two variables, `sum` and `diff`, to store the values returned by the call. Then, it plots the values of those variables on the chart:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Functions-that-return-multiple-results-1.CVZCb-PO_15cSiL.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Functions that return multiple results demo")

//@function Returns a tuple containing the sum and difference between the `val1` and `val2` values, respectively.
sumDiff(float val1, float val2) =>
    [val1 + val2, val1 - val2]

// Call `sumDiff()` with two pseudorandom arguments, and use a tuple declaration with one variable for each separate result.
[sum, diff] = sumDiff(math.random(), math.random())

// Plot the `sum` and `diff` series.
plot(sum,  "Sum",        color.teal,   3)
plot(diff, "Difference", color.maroon, 3)
```

In some cases, a script might not require *all* the results from the tuple returned by a function call. Instead of writing unique identifiers for every variable in the tuple declaration, programmers can [use an underscore](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#using-an-underscore-_-as-an-identifier) as the identifier for each variable that the script does not require. All variables with the name `_` are *not usable* in the script’s calculations.

For example, if we change `sum` to `_` in the previous script’s tuple declaration, the first value returned by the `sumDiff()` call is *inaccessible* to the script. Attempting to use the identifier elsewhere in the code causes a *compilation error*, as shown by the first [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call in the script version below:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Using `_` in a tuple declaration demo")

//@function Returns a tuple containing the sum and difference between the `val1` and `val2` values, respectively.
sumDiff(float val1, float val2) =>
    [val1 + val2, val1 - val2]

// Declare a tuple with `_` as the first identifier, meaning the first item returned by `sumDiff()` (the sum) is
// inaccessible to the script.
[_, diff] = sumDiff(math.random(), math.random())

// The first `plot()` call now causes an error, because all `_` variables are *not usable* in a script's calculations.
plot(_,    "Sum",        color.teal,   3)
plot(diff, "Difference", color.maroon, 3)
```

NoteThe items in a function’s returned tuple can have *different* [types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#types). However, functions *cannot* return multiple results with different [type qualifiers](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#qualifiers). Therefore, *all* items in a returned tuple automatically inherit the *same qualifier*. If the tuple does not rely on a “series” value, all the items in the tuple typically inherit the *“simple”* qualifier. Otherwise, all items inherit the *“series”* qualifier. See the [Tuples](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#tuples) section of the [Type system](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/) page for an example.

## Declaring parameter types

User-defined function definitions can prefix each parameter declaration with type and qualifier *keywords*, enabling strict control over the qualified types that a script can pass to the parameter in any function call. If a declaration does not include these keywords, the compiler automatically determines the parameter’s qualified type based on its arguments and the function’s structure.

The sections below explain how type and qualifier keywords affect the behavior of function parameters. For detailed information about Pine’s types and qualifiers, refer to the [Type system](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/) page.

### Type keywords

Parameter declarations prefixed by *type keywords* — such as [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int), [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float), [string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string), or [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) — declare the [types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#types) of data that the parameters represent in any function call. If a parameter declaration includes a type keyword, it accepts only arguments of that type, or arguments that Pine can automatically [cast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#type-casting) to that type.

If a function parameter does *not* have a type keyword in its declaration, its type is initially *undefined*. In each separate call to the function, the parameter automatically inherits the *same* type as its specified argument. In other words, the parameter can take on *any type*, except for [void](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#void), depending on the function call.

The following example demonstrates this behavior. The user-defined `pass()` function in the script below returns the value of the `source` parameter without performing additional calculations. The parameter’s declaration does not include a type keyword. The script executes five calls to the function with different argument types and then uses their results in code that accepts those types. This script compiles successfully, because each call’s version of the `source` parameter inherits its argument’s type:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Declaring-parameter-types-Type-keywords-1.zDkkXyfc_9KdIq.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Undefined parameter types demo")

//@function Returns the value of the `source` argument without modification.
//          Each written call to the function can accept an argument of *any* type except for "void".
pass(source) =>
    source

plotSeries  = pass(bar_index)                         // "series int"
lineWidth   = pass(3)                                 // "const int"
plotTitle   = pass("Test plot")                       // "const string"
plotColor   = pass(chart.fg_color)                    // "input color"
plotDisplay = pass(display.all - display.status_line) // "const plot_display"

// Create a plot using the values from the five `pass()` calls.
plot(plotSeries, plotTitle, plotColor, lineWidth, display = plotDisplay)
```

We can restrict the `source` parameter’s type, and thus the arguments it can accept, by including a type keyword in its declaration. For example, in the modified script below, we added the [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int) keyword to the declaration to specify that the parameter’s type is “int”. With this change, the last three `pass()` calls now cause a compilation error, because the parameter no longer allows “string”, “color”, or “plot\_display” arguments:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Declared parameter type demo")

//@function Returns the value of the `source` argument.
//          The argument in each call must be an integer. No other type is allowed.
pass(int source) =>
    source

// These two calls are valid, because their arguments are "int" values.
plotSeries = pass(bar_index)
lineWidth  = pass(3)

// These three calls cause an error, because the `pass()` function no longer allows non-integer arguments.
plotTitle   = pass("Test plot")
plotColor   = pass(chart.fg_color)
plotDisplay = pass(display.all - display.status_line)

// Create a plot using the values from the five `pass()` calls.
plot(plotSeries, plotTitle, plotColor, lineWidth, display = plotDisplay)
```

Note that:

-   If a parameter declaration includes a type keyword *without* a qualifier keyword, such as [const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const) or [simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple), the compiler automatically sets the qualifier to *“series”* or *“simple”*, depending on the function’s calculations. In this example, the `source` parameter’s type is “series int”, because the function’s logic does not require a “simple” or weaker qualifier. See the [Qualifier keywords](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#qualifier-keywords) section to learn more.

In most cases, type keywords are *optional* in parameter declarations. However, specifying a parameter’s type is *required* if:

-   The parameter’s default argument is an [`na` value](language/type-system/#na-value).
-   The parameter declaration includes a *qualifier keyword*.
-   The function definition includes the [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export) keyword. Exported functions require declared types for *every* parameter. See the [Libraries](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/libraries/) page to learn more.
-   The function definition includes the [method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_method) keyword, and the parameter is the *first* one listed in the header. See the [User-defined methods](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/#user-defined-methods) section of the [Methods](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/) page for more information.

TipEven when not required, we recommend declaring parameter types where possible. Type keywords help promote readability, and they enable the Pine Editor to provide relevant code suggestions. Additionally, parameters with declared types help prevent *unintended* arguments in function calls.

### Qualifier keywords

A *qualifier keyword* ([const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const), [simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple), or [series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_series)) preceding a [type keyword](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#type-keywords) in a parameter declaration specifies the parameter’s [type qualifier](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#qualifiers). The keyword also indicates when the *argument* for the parameter must be accessible, and whether that argument can *change* across bars:

`const`

The parameter has the “const” qualifier. Its argument must be available at *compile time*, and that argument cannot change during any execution. Only the parameters of *non-exported* functions can use the [const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const) keyword.

`simple`

The parameter has the “simple” qualifier. Its argument must be a “simple” value or a value with a *weaker* qualifier (“input” or “const”). The value cannot change after the *first bar*.

`series`

The parameter has the “series” qualifier. It can accept an argument with *any* type qualifier, because “series” is the *highest* one in Pine’s [qualifier hierarchy](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#qualifiers). The argument for the parameter in each function call *can change* on any execution.

NoteQualifier keywords affect only the parameters that accept [value types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#value-types). They **do not** affect those that accept [reference types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#reference-types). Instances of reference types *always* have the “series” qualifier, regardless of how the script uses them. Therefore, all parameters of these types automatically inherit the “series” qualifier. See the [Type system](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/) page to learn more.

Qualifier keywords are always *optional* in parameter declarations. If a declaration does not include a qualifier keyword, the compiler uses the following logic to assign a qualifier to the parameter:

-   If the declaration does *not* include a type keyword, the compiler assigns the parameter the *same* qualifier *and* type as its argument in each written function call. For example, if the script passes a “const int” argument in one function call, the parameter of that call inherits the type “const int”. If it uses a “series float” value in another call to the function, the parameter of that call inherits the type “series float”.
-   If the declaration *does* include a type keyword, the compiler first tests whether the parameter can use the *“series”* qualifier. If the function contains a call to another function in its body, and that call *cannot* accept a “series” value, the compiler then checks whether the *“simple”* qualifier works. If neither the “series” nor “simple” qualifier is compatible with the function’s calculations, a *compilation error* occurs.

To demonstrate these behaviors, let’s revisit the `pass()` function from the [Type keywords](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#type-keywords) section. The function returns the value of its `source` parameter without additional calculations. If the parameter does not include *any* keywords in its declaration, its qualified type is that of its *argument* in each separate function call:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function Returns the value of the `source` argument without modification.
//          Each written call to the function can accept an argument of *any* type except for "void".
pass(source) =>
    source
```

The script below calls `pass()` using an “int” value with the “const” qualifier, then uses the returned value as the `length` argument in a call to [ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema) and plots the result. This script compiles successfully because our `pass()` call returns the same qualified type as its argument (“const int”), and the `length` parameter of [ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema) can accept a value of that type:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Declaring-parameter-types-Qualifier-keywords-1.UmWjQFYB_Z1fknjB.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Qualifier inheritance demo")

//@function Returns the value of the `source` argument without modification.
//          Each written call to the function can accept an argument of *any* type except for "void".
pass(source) =>
    source

//@variable The EMA smoothing length.
//          This `pass()` call's `source` parameter automatically inherits the "const" qualifier from its argument.
//          Therefore, the returned type is "const int".
int lengthVal = pass(14)

//@variable The EMA of `close - open`.
//          This call works as expected, because the `length` parameter of `ta.ema()` can accept "int" values with
//          "simple" or weaker qualifiers.
float emaDiff = ta.ema(close - open, length = lengthVal)

// Plot the `emaDiff` series.
plot(emaDiff, "Smoothed difference", color.purple, 3)
```

If we add [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int) to the `source` declaration, the parameter then requires an “int” value, but it **does not** directly inherit the *same* type qualifier as its argument. Instead, the compiler first checks if it can assign *“series”* to the parameter, then tries using *“simple”* if “series” does not work.

Our `pass()` function does not use the `source` parameter in any local function calls that require a “simple int” value, so the compiler sets its qualifier to **“series”**. Consequently, the function’s returned type is always *“series int”*, even if the `source` argument is a “const” value. Adding this change to the previous script thus causes a *compilation error*, because the `length` parameter of [ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema) cannot accept a “series” argument; only “simple” or weaker qualifiers are allowed:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Qualifier promotion demo")

//@function Returns the value of the `source` parameter. Requires an integer.
pass(int source) =>
    source

//@variable The EMA smoothing length.
//          This `pass()` call's `source` parameter **does not** inherit the "const" qualifier.
//          Its type is promoted to "series int".
int lengthVal = pass(14)

// This call causes a *compilation error*. The `length` parameter cannot accept a "series int" value.
float emaDiff = ta.ema(close - open, length = lengthVal)

// Plot the `emaDiff` series.
plot(emaDiff, "Smoothed difference", color.purple, 3)
```

We can restrict the type qualifier of our function’s `source` parameter by adding a *qualifier keyword* to its declaration. In the script version below, we prefixed the declaration with the [simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple) keyword. Now, the `source` parameter’s type is *“simple int”* instead of “series int”. With this change, the script *does not* cause an error, because the `pass()` function’s returned type is now compatible with the `length` parameter of [ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema):

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Declaring-parameter-types-Qualifier-keywords-2.3l-V8A-N_Z29evjm.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Declared parameter qualifier demo")

//@function Returns the value of the `source` argument. Requires an "int" value with
//          "simple" or a weaker qualifier.
pass(simple int source) =>
    source

//@variable The EMA smoothing length.
//          This `pass()` call's result is a "simple int" value, because the function definition explicitly
//          declares that the `source` parameter's qualifier is "simple".
int lengthVal = pass(14)

// This call does not cause an error. The qualified type of `lengthVal` matches the `length` parameter's type.
float emaDiff = ta.ema(close - open, length = lengthVal)

// Plot the `emaDiff` series.
plot(emaDiff, "Smoothed difference", color.teal, 3)
```

For some types of calculations, using “series” values might not cause a compilation error, but if the values do not remain consistent across all bars, the calculations produce incorrect or unintended results. When wrapping such calculations in a function, declaring the relevant parameters with the [simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple) keyword — or [const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const) when appropriate — ensures that only *unchanging* arguments are allowed in each call, preventing unintended behavior.

Let’s look at an example. The following `calcAvg()` function calculates a moving average of a `source` series over `length` bars. The function compares the value of its `avgType` parameter in a [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch) statement to select a built-in `ta.*()` call to use for the average calculation:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function Calculates a moving average of a `source` series over `length` bars.
//          The selected average calculation depends on the `avgType` value.
calcAvg(float source, int length, string avgType) =>
    switch avgType
        "ema" => ta.ema(source, length)
        "sma" => ta.sma(source, length)
        "wma" => ta.wma(source, length)
        "hma" => ta.hma(source, length)
```

The compiler raises a *warning* about this function’s structure inside the Pine Editor, because using `calcAvg()` with a *dynamic* `avgType` argument can cause *unintended results*. If the `ta.*()` call executed by the function changes on any bar, it affects the *history* of values used in the average calculations. See the [Time series in scopes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/#time-series-in-scopes) section of the [Execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) page for advanced details about this behavior.

The script below executes two `calcAvg()` calls and plots their returned values. The first call consistently uses `"ema"` as its `avgType` argument, and the other alternates between using `"ema"` and `"sma"` as the argument. The second call’s result *does not* often align with the first call’s result, even on the bars where its `avgType` argument is `"ema"`, because both `ta.*()` calls require *consistent* evaluation to calculate the averages for *consecutive* bars:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Declaring-parameter-types-Qualifier-keywords-3.CmT8Y_eI_IzVCv.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Inconsistent behavior demo", overlay = true, behind_chart = false)

//@function Calculates a moving average of a `source` series over `length` bars.
//          The selected average calculation depends on the `avgType` value.
calcAvg(float source, int length, string avgType) =>
    switch avgType
        "ema" => ta.ema(source, length)
        "sma" => ta.sma(source, length)
        "wma" => ta.wma(source, length)
        "hma" => ta.hma(source, length)

//@variable The 10-bar EMA of *consecutive* `close` values.
float avg1 = calcAvg(close, 10, "ema")
//@variable The EMA of `close` values from *even* bar indices, or the SMA of values from *odd* bar indices.
//          Either average uses only the values from *every other bar* in its calculation, **not** consecutive bars.
float avg2 = calcAvg(close, 10, bar_index % 2 == 0 ? "ema" : "sma")

// Plot `avg1` and `avg2` for comparison.
plot(avg1, "Consistent EMA", color.blue, 4)
plot(avg2, "Inconsistent EMA/SMA", color.purple, 3)
```

To ensure that any `calcAvg()` call calculates consistent averages without modifying the function’s logic, we can prevent it from using *dynamic* `avgType` arguments by prefixing the parameter declaration with the [simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple) keyword. With this change, the compiler does *not* raise a warning about the function — as long as the script evaluates calls to the function on *every bar* — because any `calcAvg()` call must always use the same `ta.*()` function. Now, if the script attempts to pass a “series string” value to `avgType`, a compilation error occurs:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Promoting consistency with qualifier keywords demo", overlay = true, behind_chart = false)

//@function Calculates a moving average of a `source` series over `length` bars.
//          The selected average calculation depends on the `avgType` value.
//          The average type *cannot change* across bars.
calcAvg(float source, int length, simple string avgType) =>
    switch avgType
        "ema" => ta.ema(source, length)
        "sma" => ta.sma(source, length)
        "wma" => ta.wma(source, length)
        "hma" => ta.hma(source, length)

// This `calcAvg()` call works successfully, because the `avgType` argument is a "const string" value.
float avg1 = calcAvg(close, 10, "ema")
// This `calcAvg()` call now causes an error, because a dynamic `avgType` argument is *not allowed*.
float avg2 = calcAvg(close, 10, bar_index % 2 == 0 ? "ema" : "sma")

// Plot `avg1` and `avg2` for comparison.
plot(avg1, "Consistent EMA", color.blue, 4)
plot(avg2, "Inconsistent EMA/SMA", color.purple, 3)
```

## Documenting functions

Pine Script features [annotations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#compiler-annotations) that programmers can use to document a function, its parameters, and its result directly in the source code. Annotations are *comments* that issue special *instructions* to the compiler or the Pine Editor. The editor can display the formatted text from function annotations in a pop-up window as users work with the function in their code. Additionally, the “Publish script” window uses the text from function annotations to generate default descriptions for [libraries](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/libraries/).

To annotate a function, add comment lines containing valid annotation syntax directly above the function’s header. Each annotation comment must start with `@`, immediately followed by the keyword that indicates its purpose. Below is the syntax for all annotations that apply exclusively to function and [method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/#user-defined-methods) definitions:

`//@function <description>`

The [//@function](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#an_@function) annotation defines the *main description* of the function or method. This annotation is where the programmer documents the function’s purpose and key behaviors. The Pine Editor displays the formatted `description` text in its pop-up window while the user hovers over the function’s name or writes a function call.

`//@param <parameterName> <description>`

The [//@param](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#an_@function) annotation defines the description of a specific function *parameter*. The Pine Editor displays the `description` text beneath the parameter’s type in its pop-up window while the user *writes an argument* for that parameter in a function call.

In this syntax, `parameterName` is the name of one of the function’s *parameters*. If the annotation does not include a parameter name, or if the specified name does not match one of the listed parameters, the annotation is *ignored*.

`//@returns <description>`

The [//@returns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#an_@returns) annotation defines the description of the function’s *returned data*. The Pine Editor displays the `description` text at the bottom of the pop-up window that appears while the user hovers over the function’s name.

NoteRedundant annotations are automatically *ignored*. If two or more `//@function` or `//@returns` annotations are above a function header, only the **last** one adds a description to the function or its return expression. If two or more `//@param` annotations above the header share the same parameter name, only the **first** one defines the corresponding parameter’s description.

The following code block defines a `mixEMA()` function, which calculates an EMA of a `source` series and then mixes the EMA with that series by a specified amount (`mix`). Above the function definition, we included `//@function`, `//@param`, and `//@returns` annotations to document its purpose, parameters, and result, respectively. Users can view the formatted text from these annotations by hovering over the `mixEMA` identifier in the Pine Editor or writing a `mixEMA()` function call:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function         Calculates an EMA of a source series, and mixes it with the `source` value.
//@param source     The series of values to process.
//@param length     The length of the EMA's smoothing parameter.
//@param mix        Optional. The mix ratio. Requires a value from 0 to 1. The default is 1.
//@returns          The mixture between the `source` value and its EMA.
mixEMA(float source, int length, float mix = 1.0) =>
    // Raise an error if the `mix` value is outside the supported range.
    if mix < 0 or mix > 1
        runtime.error("The `mix` value must be a number between 0 and 1.")

    // Calculate the EMA of `source`.
    float ma = ta.ema(source, length)
    // Mix the `source` and `ma` values and return the result.
    float result = (1.0 - mix) * source + mix * ma
```

Note that:

-   The pop-up window that shows annotation text automatically *removes* most leading or repeated whitespaces in its formatted result.

The description attached to any function annotation can occupy *more than one* comment line in the source code, but only if there are *no blank lines* between each comment line. For example, the following code block contains `//@function` and `//@param` annotations that both define descriptions across *three* comment lines:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function         Calculates an EMA of a source series with a specified `length`, and then
//                  computes a mixture between the EMA and the original value based on the `mix` value.
//                  For consistency, calls to this function should execute on every bar.
//@param source     The series of values to process.
//@param length     The length of the EMA's smoothing parameter.
//@param mix        Optional. The mix ratio. Requires a value from 0 to 1. If 0, the result is the `source` value.
//                  If 1, the result is the EMA. If between 0 and 1, the result is a mixture between the two values.
//                  The default is 1.
//@returns          The mixture between the `source` value and its EMA.
mixEMA(float source, int length, float mix = 1.0) =>
    // Raise an error if the `mix` value is out of the supported range.
    if mix < 0 or mix > 1
        runtime.error("The `mix` value must be a number between 0 and 1.")

    // Calculate the EMA of `source`.
    float ma = ta.ema(source, length)
    // Mix the `source` and `ma` values and return the result.
    float result = (1.0 - mix) * source + mix * ma
```

Note that each separate comment line in an annotation block *does not* typically create a new line of text in the displayed description. Programmers can create annotations with *multiline* descriptions by adding *empty* comment lines to the annotation block. For example:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function         Calculates an EMA of a source series with a specified `length`, and then
//                  computes a mixture between the EMA and the original value based on the `mix` value.
//
//                  (**New text line**) For consistency, calls to this function should execute on every bar.
mixEMA(float source, int length, float mix = 1.0) =>
    // Raise an error if the `mix` value is out of the supported range.
    if mix < 0 or mix > 1
        runtime.error("The `mix` value must be a number between 0 and 1.")

    // Calculate the EMA of `source`.
    float ma = ta.ema(source, length)
    // Mix the `source` and `ma` values and return the result.
    float result = (1.0 - mix) * source + mix * ma
```

Annotations support a limited range of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Examples) syntax, which enables *custom text formats* in the Pine Editor’s pop-up window. The example below shows some of the syntax that the window can render. To view the annotation’s results, copy the code and hover over the `f` identifier inside the Pine Editor:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function This annotation shows some common Markdown syntax that the Pine Editor can render in its pop-up window.
//

// // Code block format
// float x = 1.5

//

f() => int(na)
```

NoteThe annotation syntax in the above example affects only the appearance of text displayed by the Pine Editor’s autosuggest feature; it **does not** affect text formatting in *script publications*. See the [Title and description](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/publishing/#title-and-description) section of the [Publishing scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/publishing/) page to learn the formatting syntax for publication descriptions.

## Function scopes

All variables, expressions, and statements have a designated [scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/programming/#what-does-scope-mean), which refers to the part of the script where they are defined and accessible. Every script has one *global* scope and zero or more *local* scopes.

Each function definition creates a distinct local scope. All code written in the function’s header and body belongs exclusively to that definition; no code outside the function can access its declared variables or parameters.

For example, the following script defines a function named `myFun()`. The function’s body contains a variable named `result`. The script attempts to use a [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call, in the global scope, to display the value of that variable. This script causes a compilation error, because the global scope *cannot* access the function’s *local* identifiers, and there is no global variable named `result`:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Inaccessible scope demo")

//@function Multiplies `x` by a pseudorandom value and returns the result.
myFun(float x = 10) =>
    // This variable belongs to the function definition; other scopes cannot access it.
    float result = math.random() * x

// This `plot()` call causes a compilation error. There is no *global* `result` variable available for plotting.
plot(result)
```

The only way for the script to use the function’s code is to execute a *function call*. Additionally, because the code in the function definition is *inaccessible* to other scopes, the script can declare separate variables in other parts of the code with the *same* identifiers as the function’s local variables and parameters. For example, the following script executes a call to the `myFun()` function and assigns its returned value to a new, *global* variable *also* named `result`. The [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call in this script does not cause an error, because only the global `result` variable is available to that call:

// This variable stores the result returned by a `myFun()` call.
// Although it shares the same name as the variable in `myFun()`, it is a completely separate variable declared

float result = myFun()

plot(result, "Global `result` series", linewidth = 3)
```

All local scopes in a script, including the scope of a function definition, are embedded into the script’s global scope. Therefore, while the global scope cannot access any variables within a function’s scope, the function *can* access any global variables declared *above* its definition.

For instance, the following script declares a `globalVar` variable before defining the `myFun()` function, then uses that variable in the function’s body. This script compiles successfully, because the function definition has access to any global variables declared before its location in the code:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Global variables in functions demo")

//@variable A global variable that holds a pseudorandom value.
var float globalVar = math.random()

//@function Multiplies `x` by a pseudorandom value, adds the value of `globalVar`, then returns the result.
//          This function can use `globalVar` in its body because the script declares the variable *first*.
myFun(float x = 10) =>
    math.random() * x + globalVar

// Assign the result of a default `myFun()` call to a new variable. The call uses `globalVar` internally.
float result = myFun()

// Plot the `result` series.
plot(result, "`result` series", color.teal, 3)
```

It’s important to note that all global variables used in a function’s body cannot change their assigned values or references during any execution of a function call. Therefore, although user-defined functions can *access* some global variables, they *cannot modify* those variables using the reassignment or compound assignment [operators](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/). Similarly, a function cannot reassign its declared parameters, because the parameters of each function call must always hold the same values or references passed to them from the scope where that call occurs.

The example script below demonstrates this limitation. It declares a global variable named `counter` with an initial value of 0. Then, it defines an `increment()` function that uses the [+=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_+=) operator to change the `counter` variable’s assigned value, causing a compilation error:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Cannot modify global variables demo")

//@variable A global variable to hold a counter value.
var int counter = 0

//@function Attempts to use `+=` to increment the global `counter` value by the value of `amountToAdd`.
//          This definition causes an error, because global variables cannot be modified
//          during the execution of a user-defined function call.
increment(int amountToAdd = 1) =>
    counter += amountToAdd

plot(increment())
```

TipIt is possible to modify the data accessed by a global variable from inside a function’s scope if that variable is of a [reference type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#reference-types), such as a [collection type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#collections) or [user-defined type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#user-defined-types). Instead of reassigning the variable, the script can use *setter functions* or *field reassignments*, depending on the type, to modify the *object* that the variable *refers* to. For examples of this advanced technique, see the [Extracting data from local scopes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/debugging/#extracting-data-from-local-scopes) section of the [Debugging](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/debugging/) page and the scope-related sections of the [Arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/), [Matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/), and [Maps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/maps/) pages.

### Scope of a function call

A function’s definition acts as a *template* for each function call. Every call *written* in the source code establishes a *separate* local scope using that definition. The parameters, variables, and expressions created for each function call are *unique* to that call, and they leave *independent* historical trails in the script’s [time series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/#time-series). Because each written call has a separate scope, with an independent history, no two calls to the same function directly affect each other.

For example, the script below contains a user-defined function named `accumulate()`. The function’s structure declares a *persistent* variable named `total` with an initial value of 0, then adds the value of its `source` parameter to that variable and returns the result. The script uses two separate `accumulate()` calls inside a [ternary operation](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-ternary-operator), and then plots the result returned by that expression. The operation triggers the first written call on every *third* bar, and the second on all other bars. Both calls use a value of 1 as their `source` argument:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Independent call scopes demo")

//@function Accumulates the values from a `source` series across executions.
//          Each written call to this function defines a *separate* scope with unique versions of `source` and `total`.
accumulate(float source) =>
    //@variable A *persistent* variable declared on only one bar, initialized with a value of 0.
    var float total = 0.0
    // Add the `source` value to `total` and return the variable's new value.
    total += source

// Use two calls to `accumulate()` with the same `source` argument inside a ternary expression.
// Each call has its own version of `total`, which updates only on bars where the script *evaluates* that call.
// These two calls thus return **different** results, because the script does not evaluate both of them on the
// *same* number of bars.
float altCallSeries = bar_index % 3 == 0 ? accumulate(1) : accumulate(1)

plot(altCallSeries, "Alternating call results", color.purple, 3)
```

Note that:

-   The `total` variable and its assigned value *persist* across bars because the variable declaration includes the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) keyword. See the [Declaration modes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#declaration-modes) section of the [Variable declarations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/) page to learn more.

Both `accumulate()` calls in this script might seem identical. However, each one has a *separate* scope with distinct versions of the `source` parameter and the `total` variable. The first call **does not** affect the second, and vice versa. As shown below, the script’s plotted value *decreases* on every third bar before increasing again on subsequent bars. This behavior occurs because each `accumulate()` call’s version of `total` increases its value only on bars where the script *evaluates* that call, and the script evaluates the first call on about *half* as many bars as the second:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Function-scopes-Scope-of-a-function-call-1.BvL7oJKj_1893SS.webp)

It is crucial to emphasize that each function call *written* in the source code has **one** unique scope created from the function’s definition. Repeated evaluations of the same written call **do not** create additional scopes with separate local variables and history. For example, a function call written in the body of a [loop](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/) performs calculations using the *same* local series on *every* iteration; it does *not* calculate on different versions of those series for each separate iteration.

The following script demonstrates this behavior. The source code includes two written calls to our previous `accumulate()` function. The script evaluates the first call in the global scope, and the second inside the body of a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop that performs 10 iterations per execution. It then plots the results of both calls in a separate pane:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Written call scopes in structures demo")

//@function Accumulates the values from a `source` series across executions.
//          Each written call to this function defines a **separate** scope with unique versions of `source` and `total`.
accumulate(float source) =>
    //@variable A *persistent* variable declared on only one bar, initialized with a value of 0.
    var float total = 0.0
    // Add the `source` value to `total` and return the variable's new value.
    total += source

//@variable Holds the result of evaluating `accumulate(1)` in the global scope. The value increases by *one* on each bar.
float globalCallRes = accumulate(1)

//@variable Initialized with `na`, then reassigned the result of an `accumulate()` call within a loop.
float loopedCallRes = na

for _ = 1 to 10
    // Reassign the `loopedCallRes` variable using the result of `accumulate(1)`.
    // This written call establishes **one** new scope with a unique version of the `total` variable.
    // The script evaluates that scope on every loop iteration, thus adding 1 to the *same* version of `total`
    // *10 times* per bar.
    loopedCallRes := accumulate(1)

// Plot the results of global and looped calls for comparison.
plot(globalCallRes, "Global call result", color.teal, 3)
plot(loopedCallRes, "Looped call result", color.red,  3)
```

A newcomer to Pine might expect the results of both `accumulate()` calls to be equal. However, the result of the call inside the loop is *10 times* that of the call evaluated in the global scope. This difference occurs because the call written in the loop does not have separate scopes for each iteration; every evaluation of that call modifies the *same* version of the persistent `total` variable. Consequently, the value returned by the loop’s `accumulate()` call increases by **10** instead of one on each bar:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/User-defined-functions-Function-scopes-Scope-of-a-function-call-2.BKLDlUMm_HXY3e.webp)

Note that:

-   Both `accumulate()` calls return the *same* result if we remove [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) from the `total` variable declaration. Without the keyword, each call’s version of the `total` variable no longer *persists*. Instead, every evaluation of the call *re-declares* the variable and initializes it to 0 before adding the value of the `source` argument.

## Function overloading

Function *overloads* are *unique versions* of a function that share the same name but differ in their required [parameter types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#declaring-parameter-types). Overloading enables function calls using the same identifier to perform *different tasks* based on their specified arguments. Programmers often write overloads to group similar calculations for specific types under a single function name, offering a convenient alternative to defining several related functions with unique names.

In Pine Script, a function overload is valid only if its definition satisfies one of the following conditions:

-   It has a different number of *required* parameters (parameters *without* default arguments) than that of any other defined overload.
-   It has the same number of required parameters as another overload, but at least *one* required parameter has a different [qualified type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/) than the one declared at the *same position* in the other overload’s header.

The following code block defines three overloads of a custom `negate()` function. Each overload has a different parameter type and performs a distinct task. The first overload uses the [\-](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_-) operator to negate a “float” or “int” value; the second uses the [not](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_not) operator to negate a “bool” value; and the third calculates the sRGB negative of a “color” value using the built-in `color.*()` functions:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function     (Overload 1) Changes the sign of a number.
//@param value  The "float" or "int" value to process.
//@returns      The negated number.
negate(float value) =>
    -value

//@function     (Overload 2) Negates a Boolean value.
//@param value  The "bool" value to process.
//@returns      `false` if the value is `true`, or `true` if the value is `false`.
negate(bool value) =>
    not value

//@function     (Overload 3) Calculates the sRGB negative (i.e., complement) of a color.
//@param value  The "color" value to process.
//@returns      The "color" value whose red, green, and blue components are opposites of the `value` color's components
//              in the sRGB color space.
negate(color value) =>
    color.rgb(255 - color.r(value), 255 - color.g(value), 255 - color.b(value), color.t(value))
```

Note that:

-   The `value` parameter of each `negate()` overload automatically inherits the *“series”* qualifier, because its declaration includes a [type keyword](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#type-keywords) *without* a [qualifier keyword](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#qualifier-keywords), and the overload does not use the parameter in a local function call that requires a “simple” or weaker qualifier.
-   We included [annotations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#compiler-annotations) to [document](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#documenting-functions) each separate overload. As a user writes a `negate()` call, the Pine Editor shows the documentation for *one* of the overloads in a pop-up window. While the window is open, the user can view the documentation for the *other* overloads by using the Up and Down arrow keys.

With our function overloads defined, we can use `negate()` calls for different type-specific tasks. The script below uses a call to each overload. First, it uses the second overload to calculate the opposite of the condition `close > open`. It then uses the negated condition to determine the value of a plotted series. The plotted value is the result of `negate(close)` if the condition is `true`, and the value of [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) otherwise. The script colors the plot using the negative of the chart’s background color (`negate(chart.bg_color)`):

//@variable `true` if the current `close` value is *not* greater than the value of `open`. Otherwise, `false`.
bool notUpBar = negate(close > open)
//@variable The `-close` value if the `notUpBar` condition is `true`, or the `close` value if the condition is `false`.
float plotSeries = notUpBar ? negate(close) : close

color plotColor = negate(chart.bg_color)

// Plot the value of `plotSeries` and color it using `plotColor`.
plot(plotSeries, "Test plot", plotColor, style = plot.style_area)
```

It’s important to emphasize that a function overload is valid only if its signature contains a *unique* set of qualified types for its *required* parameters. Differences in *optional* parameters (the parameters that have default arguments) **do not** affect the validity of overloads. The compiler raises an *error* if two overloads share the same required parameter types and differ only in optional parameters, because it cannot determine which overload to use for *all* possible function calls.

For example, the following code block defines a fourth `negate()` overload with two “float” parameters. The overload’s first parameter requires an argument, but the second one *does not* because it has a default value. With this addition, any `negate()` call with a single “float” argument becomes *ambiguous*. Such a call might refer to the first overload or the fourth, and the compiler *cannot* confirm which one to use in that case. Therefore, the extra overload causes a compilation error:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function     (Overload 1) Changes the sign of a number.
//@param value  The "float" or "int" value to process.
//@returns      The negated number.
negate(float value) =>
    -value

//@function     (Overload 2) Negates a Boolean value.
//@param value  The "bool" value to process.
//@returns      `false` if the value is `true`, or `true` if the value is `false`.
negate(bool value) =>
    not value

//@function     (Overload 3) Calculates the sRGB negative (i.e., complement) of a color.
//@param value  The "color" value to process.
//@returns      The "color" value whose red, green, and blue components are opposites of the `value` color's components
//              in the sRGB color space.
negate(color value) =>
    color.rgb(255 - color.r(value), 255 - color.g(value), 255 - color.b(value), color.t(value))


// This overload is **invalid**.
// Although the function has two parameters, `scale` has a default argument. The only parameter that requires an
// argument is `value`, and that parameter shares the same type as the required parameter in Overload 1.
// Any `negate()` call with a single "float" argument is *ambiguous* in this case, so the compiler raises an error.
negate(float value, float scale = 1.0) =>
    -value * scale
```

Another crucial limitation to note is that the *names* of parameters **do not** affect the validity of overloads. The compiler validates overloads by analyzing only the *qualified types* of their required parameters at each *position* in the function headers, because function calls can use *positional* or *named* arguments for each parameter. Named arguments specify the parameter to which they apply. For example, `f(x = 10)` passes the value 10 to the `x` parameter of the `f()` call. In contrast, positional arguments omit names and apply to the parameters in order: the first argument to the first parameter, the second to the second parameter, and so on.

If two overloads have the same parameter types but different parameter names, a compilation error occurs, because any call that uses positional arguments is ambiguous. For example, the code block below defines a separate `negate()` overload with a single “float” parameter named `comparedValue`. That overload causes a compilation error, as the required parameter’s qualified type matches that of the `value` parameter in the first overload:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@function     (Overload 1) Changes the sign of a number.
//@param value  The "float" or "int" value to process.
//@returns      The negated number.
negate(float value) =>
    -value

//@function     (Overload 2) Negates a Boolean value.
//@param value  The "bool" value to process.
//@returns      `false` if the value is `true`, or `true` if the value is `false`.
negate(bool value) =>
    not value

//@function     (Overload 3) Calculates the sRGB negative (i.e., complement) of a color.
//@param value  The "color" value to process.
//@returns      The "color" value whose red, green, and blue components are opposites of the `value` color's components
//              in the sRGB color space.
negate(color value) =>
    color.rgb(255 - color.r(value), 255 - color.g(value), 255 - color.b(value), color.t(value))


// This overload is **invalid**.
// Although the required parameter has a different name from that of Overload 1, it is possible to call the
// function using a *positional* argument. The compiler cannot determine whether calls such as `negate(close)`
// should refer to the first overload or this one, so it raises an error.
negate(float comparedValue) =>
    not (comparedValue > open)
```

In Pine, function overloads can contain calls to overloads with the *same* function name in their bodies, but only if those overloads are defined first. However, just like non-overloaded functions, an overload *cannot* use calls to *itself* within its body.

For example, the script version below defines a fourth `negate()` overload with two required “float” parameters. The new overload calculates the product of its arguments, then calls the *first* overload of `negate()` to change the result’s sign. This script compiles successfully, because the fourth overload uses a *separate* `negate()` implementation in its scope, *not* a call to itself:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

negate(float value1, float value2) =>
    // Using this call in the overload's body does not cause an error, because it is *non-recursive*.
    // It refers to the *first* `negate()` implementation, not the fourth.
    negate(value1 * value2)


//@variable `true` if the current `close` value is *not* greater than the value of `open`. Otherwise, `false`.
bool notUpBar = negate(close > open)
//@variable `-close * 2` if the `notUpBar` condition is `true`, or `close * 2` if the condition is `false`.
float plotSeries = notUpBar ? negate(close, 2) : negate(close, -2)
//@variable The sRGB negative of `color.green`.
color plotColor = negate(color.green)

// Plot the value of `plotSeries` and color it using `plotColor`.
plot(plotSeries, "Test plot", plotColor, style = plot.style_area)
```

Note that:

-   If we change the fourth overload to use a `negate()` call with *two* “float” arguments, a compilation error occurs because the overload calls *itself* in that case. Even if Pine allowed recursive functions, using such an overload would cause an error because it creates the equivalent of an *infinite loop*, where a single call activates a second call, the second call activates a third one, and so on.

## Limitations

This section explains several key limitations common to all user-defined functions. These same limitations also apply to [user-defined methods](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/#user-defined-methods).

### No global-only built-in function calls

The body of a user-defined function can contain calls to most other functions or [methods](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/), or previously defined [overloads](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#function-overloading) with the same function name. However, a function *cannot* use calls to the following *built-in* functions inside its scope:

-   Declaration statements: [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), and [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library).
-   Plot-related functions: [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline), [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill), [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape), [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar), [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow), [plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar), [plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle), [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor), [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor), and [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition).

Global variables can be assigned values returned by functions in order to be used in calls to the above functions. However, the calls to these functions are allowed only in the script’s [global scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/programming/#what-does-scope-mean), outside the operands of [ternary operations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-ternary-operator) or other conditional expressions.

### Consistent types for each call

Each written call to a user-defined function must have *consistent* parameter types and return types during each evaluation of that call. The call *cannot* accept varying argument types throughout the script’s runtime, nor can it change its return type. Similar limitations also apply to other structures and expressions, including [loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/), [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/), and ternary operations.

### Cannot modify global variables or parameters

The body of a user-defined function cannot use the *reassignment* or *compound assignment* [operators](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/) to modify variables declared in the *global scope*. Likewise, it cannot use these operators to reassign function *parameters*. The value or reference assigned to a global variable or the parameter of a function call *cannot change* while the script evaluates the call. See the [Function scopes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#function-scopes) section for an example.

### No nested definitions

The body of a user-defined function *cannot* contain the definition of another user-defined function. Likewise, [loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/) and [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/) cannot include function definitions in their local blocks. Function and [method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/#user-defined-methods) definitions are allowed only in the script’s *global scope*.

For example, the following `f()` function definition causes a compilation error, because it attempts to define another function, `g()`, within its body:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Invalid nested definition demo")

f(x, y) =>
    // Defining a separate function inside the body of `f()` is not allowed.
    g(a, b) => math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
    g(x, y) / (x + y)

plot(f(open, close))
```

Instead of attempting to define `g()` within the scope of `f()`, we can move the definition of `g()` above `f()` in the global scope:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Moving nested definitions to the global scope demo")

// If we move `g()` to the global scope, above `f()`, the `f()` function can use it, and no error occurs.
g(a, b) => math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)

f(x, y) =>
    g(x, y) / (x + y)

plot(f(open, close))
```

### No recursive functions

In contrast to functions in some programming languages, user-defined functions in Pine Script *cannot* contain calls to *themselves* within their bodies. Instead of using recursive function structures, programmers can replace those structures with equivalent [loop](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/) calculations.

For instance, the following `gcd()` function causes a compilation error because it includes a `gcd()` call within its body:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Invalid recursive function demo")

gcd(int x, int y) =>
    // This expression causes an error. `gcd()` cannot call itself.
    y == 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y)

plot(gcd(15, 20))
```

Instead of attempting to use recursion, we can reformat the function’s structure to perform the necessary calculations using *iteration*. The example version below achieves our intended calculations using a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop and no recursive `gcd()` calls:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Replacing recursion with loops demo")

// This function performs the same intended calculations as the invalid recursive structure.
// It uses separate local variables to track values, and modifies those variables in a `while` loop
// until it finds the greatest common divisor for two positive integers.
gcd(int x, int y) =>
    int a = x
    int b = y
    while b != 0
        int remainder = a % b
        a := b
        b := remainder
    a

plot(gcd(15, 20))
```
