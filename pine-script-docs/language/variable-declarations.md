# Variable declarations

## Introduction

Variables are [identifiers](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/identifiers/) that hold values. They must be *declared* in your code before you use them. The syntax of variable declarations is:

```
[<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = <expression> | <structure>
```

or

```
<tuple_declaration> = <function_call> | <structure>
```

where:

-   `|` means OR, and parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one time.
-   <declaration\_mode> is the variable’s [declaration mode](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#declaration-modes). It can be [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip), or nothing.
-   <type> is a valid *type keyword* with an optional *qualifier prefix*. Specifying a variable’s type is optional in most cases. See the [Type system](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/) page to learn more.
-   <identifier> is the variable’s [name](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/identifiers/).
-   <expression> can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
-   <structure> can be an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if), [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for), [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) or [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch) *structure*.
-   <tuple\_declaration> is a comma-separated list of variable names enclosed in square brackets (`[]`), e.g., `[ma, upperBand, lowerBand]`.

These are all valid variable declarations. Note that the last declaration requires four lines of code because it uses the returned value from an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
BULL_COLOR = color.lime
i = 1
len = input(20, "Length")
float f = 10.5
closeRoundedToTick = math.round_to_mintick(close)
sma = ta.sma(close, 14)
var barRange = float(na)
var firstBarOpen = open
varip float lastClose = na
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
plotColor = if close > open
    color.green
else
    color.red
```

NoticeAll the above statements use the [\=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-assignment-operator) *assignment* operator because they are **variable declarations**. When you see similar lines containing the [:=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-reassignment-operator) operator, the code assigns a *new value* to a **declared variable**. Those lines define **variable reassignments**. Ensure you understand the distinction, as it is a common stumbling block for new Pine Script® programmers. Refer to the [Variable reassignment](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#variable-reassignment) section below for more information.

The formal syntax of a variable declaration is:

```
<variable_declaration>    [<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = <expression> | <structure>    |    <tuple_declaration> = <function_call> | <structure>
<declaration_mode>    var | varip
<type>    int | float | bool | color | string | line | linefill | label | box | table | polyline | chart.point | array<type> | matrix<type> | map<keyType, valueType> | UDT | Enum
```

### Initialization with ​na​

In most cases, an explicit type declaration is redundant because type is automatically inferred from the value on the right of the `=` at compile time, so the decision to use them is often a matter of preference. For example:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
baseLine0 = na          // compile time error!
float baseLine1 = na    // OK
baseLine2 = float(na)   // OK
```

In the first line of the example, the compiler cannot determine the type of the `baseLine0` variable because [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) is a generic value of no particular type. The declaration of the `baseLine1` variable is correct because its [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float) type is declared explicitly. The declaration of the `baseLine2` variable is also correct because its type can be derived from the expression `float(na)`, which is an explicit cast of the [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value to the [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float) type. The declarations of `baseLine1` and `baseLine2` are equivalent.

### Tuple declarations

Function calls or structures are allowed to return multiple values. When we call them and want to store the values they return, a *tuple declaration* must be used, which is a comma-separated set of one or more values enclosed in brackets. This allows us to declare multiple variables simultaneously. As an example, the [ta.bb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dbb) built-in function for Bollinger bands returns three values:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
[bbMiddle, bbUpper, bbLower] = ta.bb(close, 5, 4)
```

### Using an underscore (​\_​) as an identifier

When declaring a variable, it is possible to use a single underscore (`_`) as its identifier. A value assigned to such a variable cannot be accessed. You can assign any number of values to a `_` identifier anywhere in the script, even if the current scope already has such an assignment.

This is particularly useful when a tuple returns unneeded values. Let’s write another Bollinger Bands script. Here, we only need the bands themselves, without the center line:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Underscore demo")

// We do not need the middle Bollinger Bands value, and do not use it.
// To make this clear, we assign it to the `_` identifier.
[_, bbUpper, bbLower] = ta.bb(close, 5, 4)

// We can continue to use `_` in the same code without causing compilation errors:
[bbMiddleLong, _, _] = ta.bb(close, 20, 2)

plot(bbUpper)
```

## Variable reassignment

A variable reassignment is done using the [:=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator. It can only be done after a variable has been first declared and given an initial value. Reassigning a new value to a variable is often necessary in calculations, and it is always necessary when a variable from the global scope must be assigned a new value from within a structure’s local block, e.g.:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
sensitivityInput = input.int(2, "Sensitivity", minval = 1, tooltip = "Higher values make color changes less sensitive.")
ma = ta.sma(close, 20)
maUp = ta.rising(ma, sensitivityInput)
maDn = ta.falling(ma, sensitivityInput)

// On first bar only, initialize color to gray
var maColor = color.gray
if maUp
    // MA has risen for two bars in a row; make it lime.
    maColor := color.lime
else if maDn
    // MA has fallen for two bars in a row; make it fuchsia.
    maColor := color.fuchsia

plot(ma, "MA", maColor, 2)
```

Note that:

-   We initialize `maColor` on the first bar only, so it preserves its value across bars.
-   On every bar, the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement checks if the MA has been rising or falling for the user-specified number of bars (the default is 2). When that happens, the value of `maColor` must be reassigned a new value from within the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) local blocks. To do this, we use the [:=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator.
-   If we did not use the [:=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator, the effect would be to initialize a new `maColor` local variable which would have the same name as that of the global scope, but actually be a very confusing independent entity that would persist only for the length of the local block, and then disappear without a trace.

All user-defined variables in Pine Script are *mutable*, which means their value can be changed using the [:=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator. Assigning a new value to a variable may change its *type qualifier* (see the page on Pine Script’s [type system](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/) for more information). A variable can be assigned a new value as many times as needed during the script’s execution on one bar, so a script can contain any number of reassignments of one variable. A variable’s [declaration mode](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#declaration-modes) determines how new values assigned to a variable will be saved.

## Declaration modes

Understanding the impact that declaration modes have on the behavior of variables requires prior knowledge of Pine Script’s [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/).

When you declare a variable, if a declaration mode is specified, it must come first. Three modes can be used:

-   “On each bar”, when none is specified
-   [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
-   [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)

### On each bar

When no explicit declaration mode is specified, i.e. no [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword is used, the variable is declared and initialized on each bar, e.g., the following declarations from our first set of examples in this page’s introduction:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
BULL_COLOR = color.lime
i = 1
len = input(20, "Length")
float f = 10.5
closeRoundedToTick = math.round_to_mintick(close)
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
plotColor = if close > open
    color.green
else
    color.red
```

### ​var​

When the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) keyword is used, the variable is only initialized once, on the first bar if the declaration is in the global scope, or the first time the local block is executed if the declaration is inside a local block. After that, it will preserve its last value on successive bars, until we reassign a new value to it. This behavior is very useful in many cases where a variable’s value must persist through the iterations of a script across successive bars. For example, suppose we’d like to count the number of green bars on the chart:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Green Bars Count")
var count = 0
isGreen = close >= open
if isGreen
    count := count + 1
plot(count)
```

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/GreenBarsCount.Cx1nQdL0_Z2kYId.webp)

Without the `var` modifier, variable `count` would be reset to zero (thus losing its value) every time a new bar update triggered a script recalculation.

Declaring variables on the first bar only is often useful to manage drawings more efficiently. Suppose we want to extend the last bar’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) line to the right of the right chart. We could write:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Inefficient version", "", true)
closeLine = line.new(bar_index - 1, close, bar_index, close, extend = extend.right, width = 3)
line.delete(closeLine[1])
```

but this is inefficient because we are creating and deleting the line on each historical bar and on each update in the realtime bar. It is more efficient to use:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Efficient version", "", true)
var closeLine = line.new(bar_index - 1, close, bar_index, close, extend = extend.right, width = 3)
if barstate.islast
    line.set_xy1(closeLine, bar_index - 1, close)
    line.set_xy2(closeLine, bar_index, close)
```

Note that:

-   We initialize `closeLine` on the first bar only, using the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) declaration mode
-   We restrict the execution of the rest of our code to the chart’s last bar by enclosing our code that updates the line in an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast) structure.

There is a very slight penalty performance for using the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) declaration mode. For that reason, when declaring constants, it is preferable not to use [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) if performance is a concern, unless the initialization involves calculations that take longer than the maintenance penalty, e.g., functions with complex code or string manipulations.

### ​varip​

Understanding the behavior of variables using the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) declaration mode requires prior knowledge of Pine Script’s [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) and [bar states](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/bar-states/).

The [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword can be used to declare variables that escape the *rollback process*, which is explained in the page on Pine Script’s [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/).

Whereas scripts only execute once at the close of historical bars, when a script is running in realtime, it executes every time the chart’s feed detects a price or volume update. At every realtime update, Pine Script’s runtime normally resets the values of a script’s variables to their last committed value, i.e., the value they held when the previous bar closed. This is generally handy, as each realtime script execution starts from a known state, which simplifies script logic.

Sometimes, however, script logic requires code to be able to save variable values **between different executions** in the realtime bar. Declaring variables with [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) makes that possible. The “ip” in [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) stands for *intrabar persist*.

Let’s look at the following code, which does not use [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("")
int updateNo = na
if barstate.isnew
    updateNo := 1
else
    updateNo := updateNo + 1

plot(updateNo, style = plot.style_circles)
```

On historical bars, [barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew) is always true, so the plot shows a value of “1” because the `else` part of the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) structure is never executed. On realtime bars, [barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew) is only [true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true) when the script first executes on the bar’s “open”. The plot will then briefly display “1” until subsequent executions occur. On the next executions during the realtime bar, the second branch of the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement is executed because [barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew) is no longer true. Since `updateNo` is initialized to [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) at each execution, the `updateNo + 1` expression yields [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), so nothing is plotted on further realtime executions of the script.

If we now use [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) to declare the `updateNo` variable, the script behaves very differently:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("")
varip int updateNo = na
if barstate.isnew
    updateNo := 1
else
    updateNo := updateNo + 1

plot(updateNo, style = plot.style_circles)
```

The difference now is that `updateNo` tracks the number of realtime updates that occur on each realtime bar. This can happen because the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) declaration allows the value of `updateNo` to be preserved between realtime updates; it is no longer rolled back at each realtime execution of the script. The test on [barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew) allows us to reset the update count when a new realtime bar comes in.

Because [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) only affects the behavior of your code in the realtime bar, it follows that backtest results on strategies designed using logic based on [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) variables will not be able to reproduce that behavior on historical bars, which will invalidate test results on them. This also entails that plots on historical bars will not be able to reproduce the script’s behavior in realtime.
