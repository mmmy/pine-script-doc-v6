# Loops

## Introduction

Loops are structures that repeatedly execute a block of statements based on specified criteria. They allow scripts to perform repetitive tasks without requiring duplicated lines of code. Pine Script® features three distinct loop types: [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#for-loops), [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#while-loops), and [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops).

Every loop structure in Pine Script consists of two main parts: a *loop header* and a *loop body*. The loop header determines the criteria under which the loop executes. The loop body is the indented block of code ([local block](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#scope)) that the script executes on each loop cycle (*iteration*) as long as the header’s conditions remain valid. See the [Common characteristics](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#common-characteristics) section to learn more.

Understanding when and how to use loops is essential for making the most of the power of Pine Script. Inefficient or [unnecessary](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#when-loops-are-unnecessary) usage of loops can lead to suboptimal runtime performance. However, effectively using loops [when necessary](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#when-loops-are-necessary) enables scripts to perform a wide range of calculations that would otherwise be impractical or impossible without them.

### When loops are unnecessary

Pine’s [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) and [time series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/#time-series) structure make loops *unnecessary* in many situations.

When a user adds a Pine script to a chart, it runs within the equivalent of a *large loop*, executing its code once on *every* historical bar and realtime tick in the available data. Scripts can access the values from the executions on previous bars with the [history-referencing operator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-history-referencing-operator), and calculated values can *persist* across executions when assigned to variables declared with the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keywords. These capabilities enable scripts to utilize bar-by-bar calculations to accomplish various tasks instead of relying on explicit loops.

In addition, several [built-ins](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/built-ins/), such as those in the `ta.*` namespace, are internally optimized to eliminate the need to use loops for various calculations.

Let’s consider a simple example demonstrating unnecessary loop usage in Pine Script. To calculate the average [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) over a specified number of bars, newcomers to Pine may write a code like the following, which uses a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to calculate the sum of historical values over `lengthInput` bars and divides the result by the `lengthInput`:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-When-loops-are-unnecessary-1.BXNHgEl8_1LIA2B.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Unnecessary loops demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int lengthInput = input.int(defval = 20, title = "Length")

//@variable The sum of `close` values over `lengthInput` bars.
float closeSum = 0

// Loop over the most recent `lengthInput` bars, adding each bar's `close` to the `closeSum`.
for i = 0 to lengthInput - 1
    closeSum += close[i]

//@variable The average `close` value over `lengthInput` bars.
float avgClose = closeSum / lengthInput

// Plot the `avgClose`.
plot(avgClose, "Average close", color.orange, 2)
```

Using a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#for-loops) loop is an **unnecessary**, inefficient way to accomplish tasks like this in Pine. There are several ways to utilize the [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) and the available built-ins to eliminate this loop. Below, we replaced these calculations with a simple call to the [ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma) function. This code is shorter, and it achieves the same result much more efficiently:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-When-loops-are-unnecessary-2.BqNbiiYY_ZoMQmT.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Unnecessary loops corrected demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int lengthInput = input.int(defval = 20, title = "Length")

//@variable The average `close` value over `lengthInput` bars.
float avgClose = ta.sma(close, lengthInput)

// Plot the `avgClose`.
plot(avgClose, "Average close", color.blue, 2)
```

Note that:

-   Users can see the substantial difference in efficiency between these two example scripts by analyzing their performance with the [Pine Profiler](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/profiling-and-optimization/#pine-profiler).

### When loops are necessary

Although Pine’s [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/), [time series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/#time-series), and available [built-ins](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/built-ins/) often eliminate the need for loops in many cases, not all iterative tasks have loop-free alternatives. Loops *are necessary* for several types of tasks, including:

-   Iterating through or manipulating [collections](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#collections) ([arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/), [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/), and [maps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/maps/))
-   Performing calculations that one **cannot** accomplish with loop-free expressions or the available built-ins
-   Looking back through history to analyze past bars with a reference value only available on the *current bar*

For example, a loop is *necessary* to identify which past bars’ [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) values are above the current bar’s [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) because the current value is **not** obtainable during a script’s executions on previous bars. The script can only access the current bar’s value while it executes on that bar, and it must *look back* through the historical series during that execution to compare the previous values.

The script below uses a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#for-loops) loop to compare the [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) values of `lengthInput` previous bars with the last historical bar’s [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high). Within the loop, it calls [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) to draw a circular [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) above each past bar that has a [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) value exceeding that of the last historical bar:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-When-loops-are-necessary.Bpzukabm_Z288WAS.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Necessary loop demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of previous `high` values to compare to the last historical bar's `high`. 
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1, 500)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Draw a horizontal line segment at the last historical bar's `high` to visualize the level. 
    line.new(bar_index - lengthInput, high, bar_index, high, color = color.gray, style = line.style_dashed, width = 2)
    // Create a `for` loop that counts from 1 to `lengthInput`.
    for i = 1 to lengthInput
        // Draw a circular `label` above the bar from `i` bars ago if that bar's `high` is above the current `high`.
        if high[i] > high
            label.new(
                 bar_index - i, na, "", yloc = yloc.abovebar, color = color.purple, 
                 style = label.style_circle, size = size.tiny
             )

// Highlight the last historical bar.
barcolor(barstate.islastconfirmedhistory ? color.orange : na, title = "Last historical bar highlight")
```

Note that:

-   Each *iteration* of the [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop retrieves a previous bar’s [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) with the history-referencing operator [\[\]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D), using the loop’s *counter* (`i`) as the historical offset. The [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call also uses the counter to determine each label’s x-coordinate.
-   The [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration statement includes `max_labels_count = 500`, meaning the script can show up to 500 [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) on the chart.
-   The script calls [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor) to highlight the last historical chart bar, and it draws a horizontal [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) at that bar’s [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) for visual reference.

## Common characteristics

The [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#for-loops), [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#while-loops), and [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) loop statements all have similarities in their structure, syntax, and general behavior. Before we explore each specific loop type, let’s familiarize ourselves with these characteristics.

### Structure and syntax

In any loop statement, programmers define the criteria under which a script remains in a loop and performs *iterations*, where an iteration refers to *one execution* of the code within the loop’s [local block](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#scope) (*body*). These criteria are part of the *loop header*. A script evaluates the header’s criteria *before* each iteration, only allowing new iterations to occur while they remain valid. When the header’s criteria are no longer valid, the script *exits* the loop and skips over its body.

The specific header syntax varies with each loop statement ([for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for), [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while), or [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)) because each uses *distinct* criteria to control its iterations. Effective use of loops entails choosing the structure with control criteria best suited for a script’s required tasks. See the [\`for\` loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#for-loops), [\`while\` loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#while-loops), and [\`for…in\` loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) sections below for more information on each loop statement and its control criteria.

All loop statements in Pine Script follow the same general syntax:

```
[variables = | :=] loop_header    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where:

-   `loop_header` represents the loop structure’s header statement, which defines the criteria that control the loop’s iterations.
-   `statements` represents the code statements and expressions within the loop’s body, i.e., the *indented* block of code beneath the loop header. All code within the body belongs to the loop’s [local scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#scope).
-   `continue` and `break` are loop-specific *keywords* that control the flow of a loop’s iterations. The `continue` keyword instructs the script to *skip* the remainder of the current loop iteration and *continue* to the next iteration. The `break` keyword prompts the script to *stop* the current iteration and *exit* the loop entirely. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#keywords-and-return-expressions) below for more information.
-   `return_expression` refers to the *last* code line or block within the loop’s body. The loop returns the results from this code after the final iteration. If the loop skips parts of some iterations or stops prematurely due to a `continue` or `break` statement, the returned values or references are those of the latest iteration that evaluated this code. To use the loop’s returned results, assign them to a variable or [tuple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#tuples).
-   `variables` represents an optional variable or tuple to hold the values or references from the last evaluation of the `return_expression`. The script can assign the loop’s returned results to variables only if the results are not [void](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#void). If the loop’s conditions prevent iteration, or if no iterations evaluate the `return_expression`, the variables’ assigned values and references are [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

Note

If a script initializes a variable with a loop’s result using the above syntax, and that [variable declaration](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/) includes the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword, the loop ends *immediately* after its **first** iteration, even if the header’s criteria allow more iterations.

  

To assign a loop’s result to a [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) variable while enabling the loop to perform all required iterations, programmers can do either of the following:

-   Declare the variable before the loop, then use the [reassignment operator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-reassignment-operator) (`:=`) in the above syntax to *update* the variable.
-   Move the loop into a [user-defined function](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/), then initialize the variable with the result of a call to that function.

### Scope

All code lines that a script executes within a loop must have an indentation of *four spaces* or a *tab* relative to the loop’s header. The indented lines following the header define the loop’s *body*. This code represents a *local block*, meaning that all the definitions within the body are accessible only during the loop’s execution. In other words, the code within the loop’s body is part of its *local scope*.

Scripts can modify and [reassign](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#variable-reassignment) most variables from *outer* scopes inside a loop. However, any variables declared within the loop’s body strictly belong to that loop’s local scope. A script **cannot** access a loop’s declared variables *outside* its local block.

Note that:

-   Variables declared within a loop’s *header* are also part of the local scope. For instance, a script cannot use the *counter variable* in a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop anywhere but within the loop’s local block.

The body of any Pine loop statement can include [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/) and *nested* loop statements. When a loop includes nested structures, each structure within the body maintains a *distinct* local scope. For example, variables declared within an *outer* loop’s scope are accessible to an *inner* loop. However, any variables declared within the inner loop’s scope are **not** accessible to the outer loop.

The simple example below demonstrates how a loop’s local scope works. This script calls [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) within a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop on the last historical bar to draw [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) above `lengthInput` past bars. The color of each label depends on the `labelColor` variable declared *within* the loop’s local block, and each label’s location depends on the loop counter (`i`):

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-Common-characteristics-Scope.C3aeQeOf_uwxmQ.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Loop scope demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Lookback length", 1)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    for i = 1 to lengthInput
        //@variable Has a value of `color.blue` if `close[i]` is above the current `close`, `color.orange` otherwise.
        //          This variable is LOCAL to the `for` loop's scope.
        color labelColor = close[i] > close ? color.blue : color.orange
        // Display a colored `label` on the historical `high` from `i` bars back, using `labelColor` to set the color.
        label.new(bar_index - i, high[i], "", color = labelColor, size = size.normal)
```

In the above code, the `i` and `labelColor` variables are only accessible to the [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop’s local scope. They are **not** usable within any outer scopes. Here, we added a [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call *after* the loop with `bar_index - i` as the `x` argument and `labelColor` as the `color` argument. This code causes a *compilation error* because neither `i` nor `labelColor` are valid variables in the outer scope:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Loop scope demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Lookback length", 1)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    for i = 1 to lengthInput
        //@variable Has a value of `color.blue` if `close[i]` is above the current `close`, `color.orange` otherwise.
        //          This variable is LOCAL to the `for` loop's scope.
        color labelColor = close[i] > close ? color.blue : color.orange
        // Display a colored `label` on the historical `high` from `i` bars back, using `labelColor` to set the color.
        label.new(bar_index - i, high[i], "", color = labelColor, size = size.normal)

    // Call `label.new()` to using the `i` and `labelColor` variables outside the loop's local scope.
    // This code causes a compilation error because these variables are not accessible in this location.  
    label.new(
         bar_index - i, low, "Scope test", textcolor = color.white, color = labelColor, style = label.style_label_up
     )
```

### Keywords and return expressions

Every loop in Pine Script implicitly *returns* values, references, or [void](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#void). A loop’s returned results come from the *latest* execution of the *last* expression or nested structure within its body as of the final iteration. The results are usable only if they are not of the [void](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#void) type. Loops return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) results for values or references when no iterations occur. Scripts can add a variable or tuple assignment to a loop statement to hold the returned results for use in additional calculations outside the loop’s [local scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#scope).

The values or references that a loop returns usually come from evaluating the last written expression or nested code block on the *final* iteration. However, a loop’s body can include `continue` and `break` keywords to control the flow of iterations beyond the criteria the loop header specifies, which can also affect the returned results. Programmers often include these keywords within [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/) to control how iterations behave when certain conditions occur.

The `continue` keyword instructs a script to *skip* the remaining statements and expressions in the current loop iteration, re-evaluate the loop header’s criteria, and proceed to the *next* iteration. The script *exits* the loop if the header’s criteria do not allow another iteration.

The `break` keyword instructs a script to *stop* the loop entirely and immediately *exit* at that point without allowing any subsequent iterations. After breaking the loop, the script skips any remaining code within the loop’s body and *does not* re-evaluate the header’s criteria.

If a loop skips parts of iterations or stops prematurely due to a `continue` or `break` statement, it returns the values and references from the *last iteration* where the script *evaluated* the return expression. If the script did not evaluate the return expression across *any* of the loop’s iterations, the loop returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) results for all non-void types.

The example below selectively displays numbers from an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) on the last historical bar. It uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to iterate through the array’s elements and build a “string” to use as the displayed text. The loop’s body contains an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement that controls the flow of specific iterations. If the `number` in the current iteration is 8, the script immediately *exits* the loop using the `break` keyword. Otherwise, if the `number` is even, it *skips* the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one using the `continue` keyword.

If neither of the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement’s conditions occur, the script evaluates the *last expression* within the loop’s body (i.e., the return expression), which converts the current `number` to a “string” and concatenates the result with the `tempString` value. The loop returns the *last evaluated result* from this expression after termination. The script assigns the returned value to the `finalLabelText` variable and uses that variable as the `text` argument in the [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-Common-characteristics-Keywords-and-return-expressions.DPxrsv1p_Zh1F86.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Loop keywords and variable assignment demo")

//@variable An `array` of arbitrary "int" values to selectively convert to "string" and display in a `label`.
var array<int> randomArray = array.from(1, 5, 2, -3, 14, 7, 9, 8, 15, 12)

// Label creation logic.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A "string" containing representations of selected values from the `randomArray`.
    string tempString = ""
    //@variable The final text to display in the `label`. The `for..in` loop returns the result after it terminates.
    string finalLabelText = for number in randomArray
        // Stop the current iteration and exit the loop if the `number` from the `randomArray` is 8.
        if number == 8             
            break 
        // Skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration if the `number` is even.   
        else if number % 2 == 0   
            continue
        // Convert the `number` to a "string", append ", ", and concatenate the result with the current `tempString`.
        // This code represents the loop's return expression. 
        tempString += str.tostring(number) + ", "
    
    // Display the value of the `finalLabelText` within a `label` on the current bar.
    label.new(bar_index, 0, finalLabelText, color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge)
```

Note that:

-   The [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) displays only *odd* numbers from the [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) because the script does not reassign the `tempString` when the loop iteration’s `number` is even. However, it does not include the *last* odd number from the array (15) because the loop stops when `number == 8`, preventing iteration over the remaining `randomArray` elements.
-   When the script exits the loop due to the `break` keyword, the loop’s return value becomes the last evaluated result from the `tempString` reassignment expression. In this case, the last time that code executes is on the iteration where `number == 9`.

## ​for​ loops

The [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop statement creates a *count-controlled* loop, which uses a *counter* variable to manage the iterative executions of its local code block. The counter starts at a predefined initial value, and the loop increments or decrements the counter by a fixed amount after each iteration. The loop stops its iterations after the counter reaches a specified final value.

Pine Script uses the following syntax to define a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop:

```
[variables = | :=] for counter = from_num to to_num [by step_num]    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where the following parts define the *loop header*:

-   `counter` represents the counter variable, which can be any valid identifier. The loop increments or decrements this variable’s value from the initial value (`from_num`) to the final value (`to_num`) by a fixed amount (`step_num`) after each iteration. The last possible iteration occurs when the variable’s value reaches the `to_num` value.
-   `from_num` is the `counter` variable’s initial value on the first iteration.
-   `to_num` is the *final* `counter` value for which the loop’s header allows a new iteration. The loop adjusts the `counter` value by the `step_num` amount until it reaches or passes this value. If the script modifies the `to_num` during a loop iteration, the loop header uses the new value to control the allowed subsequent iterations.
-   `step_num` is a positive value representing the amount by which the `counter` value increases or decreases until it reaches or passes the `to_num` value. If the `from_num` value is greater than the *initial* `to_num` value, the loop *subtracts* this amount from the `counter` value after each iteration. Otherwise, the loop *adds* this amount after each iteration. The default is 1.

Refer to the [Common characteristics](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#common-characteristics) section above for detailed information about the `variables`, `statements`, `continue`, `break`, and `return_expression` parts of the loop’s syntax.

This simple script demonstrates a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop that draws several [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/text-and-shapes/#labels) at future bar indices during its execution on the last historical chart bar. The loop’s counter starts at 0, then increases by 1 until it reaches a value of 10, at which point the final iteration occurs:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Simple `for` loop demo")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Define a `for` loop that iterates from `i == 0` to `i == 10` by 1 (11 total iterations).
    for i = 0 to 10
        // Draw a new label `i` bars ahead of the current bar.  
        label.new(bar_index + i, 0, str.tostring(i), textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
```

Note that:

-   The `i` variable represents the loop’s *counter*. This variable is local to the loop’s [scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#scope), meaning no *outer scopes* can access it. The code uses the variable within the loop’s body to determine the location and text of each [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) drawing.
-   Programmers often use `i`, `j`, and `k` as loop counter identifiers. However, *any* valid variable name is allowed. For example, this code behaves the same if we name the counter `offset` instead of `i`.
-   The [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop structure *automatically* manages the counter variable. We do not need to define code in the loop’s body to increment its value.

The direction in which a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop adjusts its counter depends on the *initial* `from_num` and `to_num` values in the loop’s header, and the direction does not change across iterations. The loop counts *upward* after each iteration when the `to_num` value is *above* the `from_num` value, as shown in the previous example. If the `to_num` value is *below* the `from_num` value, the loop counts *downward* instead.

The script below calculates and plots the [volume-weighted moving average (VWMA)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592293-volume-weighted-moving-average-vwma/) of [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) prices across a specified number of bars. Then, it uses a downward-counting [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to compare the last historical bar’s value to the values from previous bars, starting with the oldest bar in the specified lookback window. On each loop iteration, the script retrieves a previous bar’s `vwmaOpen` value, calculates the difference from the current bar’s value, and displays the result in a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) at the past bar’s opening price:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`for` loop demo", "VWMA differences", true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable Display color for indicator visuals.
const color DISPLAY_COLOR = color.rgb(17, 127, 218)

//@variable The number of bars in the `vwmaOpen` calculation.
int maLengthInput = input.int(20, "VWMA length", 1)
//@variable The number of past bars to look back through and compare to the current bar.
int lookbackInput = input.int(15, "Lookback length", 1, 500)

//@variable The volume-weighted moving average of `open` values over `maLengthInput` bars. 
float vwmaOpen = ta.vwma(open, maLengthInput)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Define a `for` loop that counts *downward* from `i == lookbackInput` to `i == 1`. 
    for i = lookbackInput to 1
        //@variable The difference between the `vwmaOpen` from `i` bars ago and the current `vwmaOpen`.
        float vwmaDifference = vwmaOpen[i] - vwmaOpen
        //@variable A "string" representation of `vwmaDifference`, rounded to two fractional digits. 
        string displayText = (vwmaDifference > 0 ? "+" : "") + str.tostring(vwmaDifference, "0.00")
        // Draw a label showing the `displayText` at the `open` of the bar from `i` bars back.
        label.new(
             bar_index - i, open[i], displayText, textcolor = color.white, color = DISPLAY_COLOR,
             style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.normal
         )

// Plot the `vwmaOpen` value.
plot(vwmaOpen, "VWMA", color = DISPLAY_COLOR, linewidth = 2)
```

Note that:

-   The script uses the loop’s counter (`i`) to within the [history-referencing operator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-history-referencing-operator) to retrieve past values of the `vwmaOpen` series. It also uses the counter to determine the location of each [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) drawing.
-   The loop in this example *decreases* the counter by one on each iteration because the final counter value in the loop’s header (`1`) is less than the starting value (`lookbackInput`).

Programmers can use [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops to iterate through [collections](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#collections), such as [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays) and [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices). The loop’s counter can serve as an *index* for retrieving or modifying a collection’s contents. For example, this code block uses [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get) inside a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to successively retrieve elements from an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
int lastIndex = array.size(myArray) - 1
for i = 0 to lastIndex
   element = array.get(i)
```

Note that:

-   Array *indexing* starts from 0, but the [array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) function *counts* array elements starting from 1. Therefore, we must subtract 1 from the array’s size to get the maximum index value. This way, the loop counter avoids representing an [out-of-bounds](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/#index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-array-size-is-yy) index on the last loop iteration.
-   The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement is often the *preferred* way to loop through [collections](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#collections). However, programmers may prefer a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop for some tasks, such as looping through stepped index values, iterating over a collection’s contents in reverse or a nonlinear order, and more. See the [Looping through arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-arrays) and [Looping through matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-matrices) sections to learn more about the best practices for looping through these collection types.

The script below executes [ta.rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi) and [ta.mom()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.mom) calls to calculate the RSI and momentum of [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices over three different lengths (10, 20, and 50), then displays the results using a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the last chart bar. It stores “string” values for the header title within [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/) and the “float” values of the calculated indicators within a 2x3 [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix). The script uses a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to access the elements in the arrays and initialize the `displayTable` header cells. It then uses *nested* [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops to iterate over the *row* and *column* indices in the `taMatrix`, access elements, convert their values to strings, and populate the remaining table cells:

    taMatrix.reshape(2, 3)

    // Initialize additional header cells within a `for` loop. 
    for i = 0 to 2
        displayTable.cell(0, i + 1, sideHeaderTitles.get(i), text_color = color.white, bgcolor = color.blue)
        displayTable.cell(i + 1, 1, topHeaderTitles.get(i), text_color = color.white, bgcolor = color.purple)

    // Use nested `for` loops to iterate through the row and column indices of the `taMatrix`.
    for i = 0 to taMatrix.rows() - 1 
        for j = 0 to taMatrix.columns() - 1
            //@variable The value stored in the `taMatrix` at the `i` row and `j` column. 
            float elementValue =  taMatrix.get(i, j)
            // Initialize a cell in the `displayTable` at the `i + 2` row and `j + 1` column showing a "string"

                 column = j + 1, row = i + 2, text = str.tostring(elementValue, "#.##"), text_color = chart.fg_color
             )
```

Note that:

-   Both [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/) of header names (`sideHeaderTitles` and `topHeaderTitles`) contain the same number of elements, enabling the script to iterate through their contents simultaneously using a single [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop.
-   The nested [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops iterate over *all* the index values in the `taMatrix`. The *outer* loop iterates over each *row* index, and the *inner* loop iterates over every *column* index on each outer loop iteration.
-   The script creates and displays the [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) only on the last historical bar and all realtime bars because the historical states of [tables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/tables/) are *never* visible. See the [Reducing drawing updates](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/profiling-and-optimization/#reducing-drawing-updates) of the [Profiling and optimization](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/profiling-and-optimization/) page for more information.

It’s important to note that a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop’s header *dynamically* evaluates the `to_num` value at the start of *every iteration*. If the `to_num` argument is a variable and the script changes its value during an iteration, the loop uses the *new value* to update its stopping condition. Likewise, the stopping condition can change across iterations when the `to_num` argument is an expression or function call that depends on data modified in the loop’s scope, such as a call to [array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) on a locally resized [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) or [str.length()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.length) on an adjusted string. Therefore, scripts can use [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops to perform iterative tasks where the exact number of required iterations is *not predictable* in advance, similar to [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loops.

For example, the following script uses a dynamic [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to determine the historical offset of the most recent bar whose [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) differs from the current bar’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) by at least one standard deviation. The script declares a `barOffset` variable with an initial value of zero and uses that variable to define the loop counter’s `to_num` boundary. Within the loop’s scope, the script increments the `barOffset` by one if the referenced bar’s `close` is not far enough from the current bar’s value. Each time the `barOffset` value increases, the loop increases its final counter value, allowing an *extra iteration*. The script plots the `barOffset` and the corresponding bar’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) for visual reference:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-For-loops-4.28vao8At_zHcik.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6 
indicator("`for` loop with dynamic `to_num` demo")

//@variable The length of the standard deviation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1, 4999)

//@variable The standard deviation of `close` prices over `lengthInput` bars. 
float stdev = ta.stdev(close, lengthInput)

//@variable The minimum bars back where the past bar's `close` differs from the current `close` by at least `stdev`.
//          Used as the weight value in the weighted average.  
int barOffset = 0

// Define a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to `barsBack`.
for i = 0 to barOffset
    // Add 1 for each bar where the distance from that bar's `close` to the current bar's `close` is less than `stdev`.
    // Each time `barsBack` increases, it changes the loop's `to_num` boundary, allowing another iteration.  
    barOffset += math.abs(close - close[i]) < stdev ? 1 : 0

//@variable A gradient color for the `barOffset` plot. 
color offsetColor = color.from_gradient(barOffset, 0, lengthInput, color.blue, color.orange)

// Plot the `barOffset` in a separate pane. 
plot(barOffset, "Bar offset", offsetColor, 1, plot.style_columns)
// Plot the historical `close` price from `barOffset` bars back in the main chart pane.
plot(close[barOffset], "Historical bar's price", color.blue, 3, force_overlay = true)
```

Note that:

-   Changing the `to_num` value on an iteration does not affect the established *direction* in which the loop adjusts its counter variable. For instance, if the loop in this example changed `barOffset` to -1 on any iteration, it would stop immediately after that iteration ends without reducing the `i` value.
-   The script uses `force_overlay = true` in the second [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call to display the historical closing price on the main chart pane.

## ​while​ loops

The [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop statement creates a *condition-controlled* loop, which uses a *conditional expression* to control the executions of its local block. The loop continues its iterations as long as the specified condition remains `true`.

Pine Script uses the following syntax to define a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop:

```
[variables = | :=] while condition    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where the `condition` in the loop’s *header* can be a literal, variable, expression, or function call that returns a “bool” value.

Refer to the [Common characteristics](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#common-characteristics) section above for detailed information about the `variables`, `statements`, `continue`, `break`, and `return_expression` parts of the loop’s syntax.

A [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop’s header evaluates its `condition` before each iteration. Consequently, when the script modifies the condition within an iteration, the loop’s header reflects those changes on the *next* iteration.

Depending on the specified condition in the loop header, a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop can behave similarly to a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop, continuing iteration until a *counter* variable reaches a specified limit. For example, the following script uses a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop and [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop to perform the same task. Both loops draw a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) displaying their respective counter value on each iteration:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-While-loops-1.D6NOmppL_ZjTEtl.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`while` loop with a counter condition demo")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // A `for` loop that creates blue labels displaying each `i` value.
    for i = 0 to 10
        label.new(
             bar_index + i, 0, str.tostring(i), color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, 
             size = size.large, style = label.style_label_down
         )

    //@variable An "int" to use as a counter within a `while` loop.
    int j = 0
    // A `while` loop that creates orange labels displaying each `j` value.
    while j <= 10
        label.new(
             bar_index + j, 0, str.tostring(j), color = color.orange, textcolor = color.white, 
             size = size.large, style = label.style_label_up
         )
        // Update the `j` counter within the local block.
        j += 1
```

Note that:

-   When a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop uses count-based logic, it must explicitly manage the user-specified counter within the local block. In contrast, a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop increments its counter automatically.
-   The script declares the variable the [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop uses as a counter *outside* the loop’s [scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#scope), meaning its value is usable in additional calculations after the loop terminates.
-   If this code did not increment the `j` variable within the [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop’s body, the value would *never* reach 10, meaning the loop would run *indefinitely* until causing a [runtime error](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/error-messages/#loop-is-too-long--500-ms).

Because a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop’s execution depends on its condition remaining `true`, and the condition might not change on a specific iteration, the *precise* number of expected iterations might not be knowable *before* the loop begins. Therefore, [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loops are often helpful in scenarios where the exact loop boundaries are *unknown*.

The script below tracks when the chart’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) crosses outside Keltner Channels with a user-specified length and channel width. When the price crosses outside the current bar’s channel, the script draws a [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box) highlighting all the previous *consecutive* bars with [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values within that price window. The script uses a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop to analyze past bars’ prices and incrementally adjust the left side of each new [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box) until the drawing covers all the latest consecutive bars in the current range:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-While-loops-2.CDUKt8KX_JSuga.webp)

    while close[i] >= channelLow and close[i] <= channelHigh
        // Adjust the left side of the box. 
        windowBox.set_left(bar_index - i)
        // Add 1 to the `i` value to check the `close` from the next bar back on the next iteration. 
        i += 1

// Plot the `channelLow` and `channelHigh` for visual reference. 
plot(channelLow, "Channel low")
plot(channelHigh, "Channel high")
```

Note that:

-   The left and right edges of [boxes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/lines-and-boxes/#boxes) sit within the horizontal *center* of their respective bars, meaning that each drawing spans from the middle of the first consecutive bar to the middle of the last bar within each window.
-   This script uses the `i` variable as a [history-referencing](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-history-referencing-operator) index within the *conditional expression* the [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop checks on each iteration. The variable **does not** behave as a loop counter, as the iteration boundaries are **unknown**. The loop executes its local block repeatedly until the condition becomes `false`.

## ​for...in​ loops

The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement creates a *collection-controlled* loop, which uses the *contents* of a [collection](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#collections) to control its iterations. This loop structure is often the preferred approach for looping through [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/), [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/), and [maps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/maps/).

A [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop traverses a collection *in order*, retrieving one of its stored items on each iteration. Therefore, the loop’s boundaries depend directly on the number of *items* ([array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) *elements*, [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) *rows*, or [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) *key-value pairs*).

Pine Script features *two* general forms of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement. The *first form* uses the following syntax:

```
[variables = | :=] for item in collection_id    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where `item` is a *variable* that holds sequential values or references from the specified `collection_id`. The variable starts with the collection’s *first item* and takes on successive items in order after each iteration. This form is convenient when a script must access values from an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) or [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) iteratively but does not require the item’s *index* in its calculations.

The *second form* has a slightly different syntax that includes a [tuple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#tuples) in its *header*:

```
[variables = | :=] for [index, item] in collection_id    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where `index` is a variable that contains the *index* or *key* of the retrieved `item`. This form is convenient when a task requires using a collection’s items *and* their indices in iterative calculations. This form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is *required* when directly iterating through the contents of a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map). See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-maps) below for more information.

Refer to the [Common characteristics](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#common-characteristics) section above for detailed information about the `variables`, `statements`, `continue`, `break`, and `return_expression` parts of the loop’s syntax.

The iterative behavior of a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop depends on the *type* of collection the header specifies as the `collection_id`:

-   When using an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) in the header, the loop performs [*element-wise* iteration](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-arrays), meaning the retrieved `item` on each iteration is one of the array’s *elements*.
-   When using a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) in the header, the loop performs [*row-wise* iteration](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-matrices), which means that each `item` represents a *row array*.
-   When using a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) in the header, the loop performs [*pair-wise* iteration](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-maps), which retrieves a *key* and corresponding *value* on each iteration.

NoticeScripts can modify the sizes of arrays and matrices directly within a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop’s local scope. When a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop changes the size of a collection during an iteration, the loop’s header uses the *updated size* to control subsequent iterations, just like an equivalent [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#for-loops) loop that uses `array.size(id) - 1` or `matrix.rows(id) - 1` as the `to_num` argument.

### Looping through arrays

Pine scripts can iterate over the elements of [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/) using any loop structure. However, the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is typically the most convenient because it automatically verifies the size of an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) when controlling iterations. With other loop structures, programmers must carefully set the header’s boundaries or conditions to *prevent* the loop from attempting to access an element at a *nonexistent* index.

For example, a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#for-loops) loop can access an array’s elements using the counter variable as the lookup index in functions such as [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get). However, programmers must ensure the counter always represents a *valid index* to prevent [out-of-bounds](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/#index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-array-size-is-yy) errors. Additionally, if an array might be *empty*, programmers must set conditions to prevent the loop’s execution entirely.

The code below shows a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop whose counter boundaries depend on the number of elements in an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array). If the array is empty, containing zero elements, the header’s final counter value is [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), which *prevents* iteration. Otherwise, the final value is *one less* than the array’s [size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) (i.e., the index of the last element):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for index = 0 to (array.size(myArray) == 0 ? na : array.size(myArray) - 1)
    element = array.get(myArray, index)
```

In contrast, a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop automatically validates an array’s size and *directly* accesses its elements, providing a more convenient solution than a traditional [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop. The line below achieves the *same effect* as the code above without requiring the programmer to define boundaries explicitly or use the [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get) function to access each element:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for element in myArray
```

The following example examines bars on a lower timeframe to gauge the strength of *intrabar* trends within each chart bar. The script uses a [request.security\_lower\_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) call to retrieve an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of intrabar [hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2) prices from a calculated `lowerTimeframe`. Then, it uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to access each `price` within the `intrabarPrices` array and compare the value to the current [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) to calculate the bar’s `strength`. The script plots the `strength` as columns in a separate pane:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-arrays-1.D-rbYJQk_ZdCBAV.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`for element in array` demo", "Intrabar strength")

//@variable A valid timeframe closest to one-tenth of the current chart's timeframe, "1" if the timeframe is too small.
var string lowerTimeframe = timeframe.from_seconds(math.max(int(timeframe.in_seconds() / 10), 60))
//@variable An array of intrabar `hl2` prices calculated from the `lowerTimeframe`.
array<float> intrabarPrices = request.security_lower_tf("", lowerTimeframe, hl2)

//@variable The excess trend strength of `intrabarPrices`. 
float strength = 0.0

// Loop directly through the `intrabarPrices` array. Each iteration's `price` represents an array element.
for price in intrabarPrices
    // Subtract 1 from the `strength` if the retrieved `price` is above the current bar's `close` price. 
    if price > close
        strength -= 1
    // Add 1 to the `strength` if the retrieved `price` is below the current bar's `close` price. 
    else if price < close
        strength += 1

//@variable Is `color.teal` when the `strength` is positive, `color.maroon` otherwise.
color strengthColor = strength > 0 ? color.teal : color.maroon

// Plot the `strength` as columns colored by the `strengthColor`.
plot(strength, "Intrabar strength", strengthColor, 1, plot.style_columns)
```

The [second form](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is a convenient solution when a script’s calculations require accessing each element *and* corresponding index within an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for [index, element] in myArray
```

For example, suppose we want to display a *numerated* list of [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) elements within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) while excluding values at specific indices. We can use the second form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop structure to accomplish this task. The simple script below declares a `stringArray` variable that references an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of predefined “string” values. On the last historical bar, the script uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to access each `index` and `element` in the `stringArray` to construct the `labelText`, which it uses in a [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call after the loop ends:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-arrays-2.CVOFB_ZV_Z20I1Ef.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`for [index, item] in array` demo", "Array numerated output")

//@variable An array of "string" values to display as a numerated list.
var array<string> stringArray = array.from("First", "Second", "Third", "Before Last", "Last")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A "string" modified within a loop to display within the `label`.
    string labelText = "Array values: \n"
    // Loop through the `stringArray`, accessing each `index` and corresponding `element`. 
    for [index, element] in stringArray
        // Skip the third `element` (at `index == 2`) in the `labelText`. Include an "ELEMENT SKIPPED" message instead. 
        if index == 2
            labelText += "-- ELEMENT SKIPPED -- \n"
            continue
        labelText += str.tostring(index + 1) + ": " + element + "\n"
    // Display the `labelText` within a `label`.
    label.new(
         bar_index, 0, labelText, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge, 
         style = label.style_label_center, textalign = text.align_left
     )
```

Note that:

-   This example adds 1 to the `index` in the [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring) call to start the numerated list with a value of `"1"`, because [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) indices always begins at 0.
-   On the *third* loop iteration, when `index == 2`, the script adds an `"-- ELEMENT SKIPPED --"` message to the `labelText` instead of the retrieved `element` and uses the `continue` keyword to skip the remainder of the iteration. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#keywords-and-return-expressions) above to learn more about loop keywords.

Let’s explore an advanced example demonstrating the utility of [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loops. The following indicator draws a fixed number of horizontal [lines](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/lines-and-boxes/#lines) at pivot high values calculated from a [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.pivothigh) call, and it analyzes the lines within a loop to determine which ones represent active (*uncrossed*) pivots.

Each time the script detects a new pivot high point, it creates a new [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line), *inserts* that line at the beginning of the `pivotLines` array, then removes the oldest element and deletes its ID using [line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete). The script accesses each [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) within the [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) using a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop, analyzing and [modifying](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/lines-and-boxes/#modifying-lines) the properties of the line referenced on each iteration. When the current [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) crosses above the `pivotLine`, the script changes its style to signify that it is no longer an active level. Otherwise, it extends the line’s `x2` coordinate and uses its price to calculate the average *active* pivot value. The script also plots each pivot high value and the average active pivot value on the chart:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-arrays-3.92QH6mmE_Z1GaAhA.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`for...in` loop with arrays demo", "Active high pivots", true, max_lines_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars required on the left and right to confirm a pivot point. 
int pivotBarsInput = input.int(5, "Pivot leg length", 1)
//@variable The number of recent pivot lines to analyze. Controls the size of the `pivotLines` array.
int maxRecentLines = input.int(20, "Maximum recent lines", 1, 500)

//@variable An array that acts as a queue holding the most recent pivot high lines. 
var array<line> pivotLines = array.new<line>(maxRecentLines)
//@variable The pivot high price, or `na` if no pivot is found.
float highPivotPrice = ta.pivothigh(pivotBarsInput, pivotBarsInput)

if not na(highPivotPrice)
    //@variable The `chart.point` for the start of the line. Does not contain `time` information.
    firstPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index - pivotBarsInput, highPivotPrice)
    //@variable The `chart.point` for the end of each line. Does not contain `time` information.
    secondPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index, highPivotPrice)
    //@variable A horizontal line at the new pivot level. 
    line hiPivotLine = line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, width = 2, color = color.green) 
    // Insert the `hiPivotLine` at the beginning of the `pivotLines` array.
    pivotLines.unshift(hiPivotLine)
    // Remove the oldest line from the array and delete its ID.
    line.delete(pivotLines.pop())

//@variable The sum of active pivot prices.
float activePivotSum = 0.0
//@variable The number of active pivot high levels.
int numActivePivots = 0

// Loop through the `pivotLines` array, directly accessing each `pivotLine` element. 
for pivotLine in pivotLines
    //@variable The `x2` coordinate of the `pivotline`.
    int lineEnd = pivotLine.get_x2()
    // Move to the next `pivotline` in the array if the current line is inactive.
    if pivotLine.get_x2() < bar_index - 1
        continue
    //@variable The price value of the `pivotLine`.
    float pivotPrice = pivotLine.get_price(bar_index)
    // Change the style of the `pivotLine` and stop extending its display if the `high` is above the `pivotPrice`.
    if high > pivotPrice
        pivotLine.set_color(color.maroon)
        pivotLine.set_style(line.style_dotted)
        pivotLine.set_width(1)
        continue
    // Extend the `pivotLine` and add the `pivotPrice` to the `activePivotSum` when the loop allows a full iteration.
    pivotLine.set_x2(bar_index)
    activePivotSum  += pivotPrice
    numActivePivots += 1

//@variable The average active pivot high value.
float avgActivePivot = activePivotSum / numActivePivots

// Plot crosses at the `highPivotPrice`, offset backward by the `pivotBarsInput`.
plot(highPivotPrice, "High pivot marker", color.green, 3, plot.style_cross, offset = -pivotBarsInput)
// Plot the `avgActivePivot` as a line with breaks.
plot(avgActivePivot, "Avg. active pivot", color.orange, 3, plot.style_linebr)
```

Note that:

-   The loop in this example executes on *every bar* because it has to compare active pivot line prices with the current [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) value, then use the remaining active prices to calculate the bar’s `avgActivePivot` value.
-   Pine Script features several ways to calculate averages, many of which *do not* require a loop. However, a loop is [necessary](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#when-loops-are-necessary) in this example because the script uses information only available on the **current bar** to determine which prices contribute toward the average.
-   The *first* form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is the most convenient option in this example because we need direct access to the [lines](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/visuals/lines-and-boxes/#lines) referenced within the `pivotLines` array, but we do not need the corresponding *index* values.

### Looping through matrices

Pine scripts can iterate over the contents of a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) in several different ways. Unlike [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays), [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/) use *two* indices to reference their elements because they store data in a *rectangular* format. The first index refers to *rows*, and the second refers to *columns*. If a programmer opts to use [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) or [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loops to iterate through [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/) instead of using [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in), they must carefully define the loop boundaries or conditions to avoid [out-of-bounds](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/#the-rowcolumn-index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-rowcolumn-size-is-yy) errors.

This code block shows a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop that performs *row-wise* iteration, looping through each *row index* in a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) and using the value in a [matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row) call to retrieve a row [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array). If the [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) is empty, the loop statement uses a final loop counter value of [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) to *prevent* iteration. Otherwise, the final counter is the last row index, which is *one less* than the value returned by [matrix.rows()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for rowIndex = 0 to (myMatrix.rows() == 0 ? na : myMatrix.rows() - 1)
    rowArray = myMatrix.row(rowIndex)
```

Note that:

-   If we replace the [matrix.rows()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows) and [matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row) calls with [matrix.columns()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.columns) and [matrix.col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.col), the loop performs *column-wise* iteration instead.

The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement is the more convenient approach to loop over and access the rows of a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) in order, as it automatically validates the number of rows and retrieves an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of the current row’s elements on each iteration:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for rowArray in myMatrix
```

When a script’s calculations require access to each row from a matrix and its corresponding *index*, programmers can use the [second form](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for [rowIndex, rowArray] in myMatrix
```

Note that:

-   The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop only performs **row-wise** iteration on [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/). To *emulate* column-wise iteration, programmers can use a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop on a [transposed copy](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/#transposing).

The following example creates a custom string representing the rows of a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) with extra information. When the script executes on the last historical bar, it creates a 3x3 matrix populated with values from [math.random()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random) calls. Using the [first form](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop, the script iterates through each row in the matrix to create a “string” value representing the row’s contents, its average, and whether the average is above 0.5. Before the end of each iteration, the script concatenates the constructed string with the `labelText` value. After the loop ends, the script creates a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) to display the `labelText` variable’s final value:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-matrices-1.MLIBFwlx_ZsMuB0.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("`for row in matrix` demo", "Custom matrix label")

//@variable Generates a pseudorandom value between 0 and 1, rounded to 4 decimal places. 
rand() =>
    math.round(math.random(), 4)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A matrix of randomized values to format and display in a `label`. 
    matrix<float> randomMatrix = matrix.new<float>()
    // Add a row of 9 randomized values and reshape the matrix to 3x3.
    randomMatrix.add_row(
         0, array.from(rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand())
     )
    randomMatrix.reshape(3, 3)

    //@variable A custom "string" representation of `randomMatrix` information. Modified within a loop.
    string labelText = "Matrix rows: \n"

    // Loop through the rows in the `randomMatrix`.
    for row in randomMatrix
        //@variable The average element value within the `row`.
        float rowAvg = row.avg()
        //@variable An upward arrow when the `rowAvg` is above 0.5, a downward arrow otherwise.
        string directionChar = rowAvg > 0.5 ? "⬆" : "⬇"
        // Add a "string" representing the `row` array, its average, and the `directionChar` to the `labelText`.
        labelText += str.format("Row: {0} Avg: {1} {2}\n", row, rowAvg, directionChar)
    
    // Draw a `label` displaying the `labelText` on the current bar.
    label.new(
         bar_index, 0, labelText, color = color.purple, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge, 
         style = label.style_label_center, textalign = text.align_left
     )
```

Working with [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/) often entails iteratively accessing their *elements*, not just their rows and columns, typically using *nested loops*. For example, this code block uses an outer [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to iterate over row indices. The inner [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop iterates over column indices on *each* outer loop iteration and calls [matrix.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.get) to access an element:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for rowIndex = 0 to (myMatrix.rows() == 0 ? na : myMatrix.rows() - 1)
    for columnIndex = 0 to myMatrix.columns() - 1
        element = myMatrix.get(rowIndex, columnIndex)
```

Alternatively, a more convenient approach for this type of task is to use nested [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loops. The outer [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop in this code block retrieves each row [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) in a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix), and the inner [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) statement [loops through that array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-arrays):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for rowArray in myMatrix
    for element in rowArray
```

The script below creates a 3x2 [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix), then accesses and modifies its elements within nested [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loops. Both loops use the [second form](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) statement to retrieve index values and corresponding items. The outer loop accesses a row index and row [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) from the [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix). The inner loop accesses each index and respective element from that [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).

Within the nested loop’s iterations, the script converts each `element` to a “string” and initializes a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) cell at the `rowIndex` row and `colIndex` column. Then, it uses the loop header variables within [matrix.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.set) to update the [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) element. After the outer loop terminates, the script displays a “string” representation of the *updated* [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label):

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Nested `for...in` loops on matrices demo")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable  A matrix containing numbers to display.
    matrix<float> displayNumbers = matrix.new<float>()
    // Populate the `displayNumbers` matrix and reshape to 3x2.
    displayNumbers.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))
    displayNumbers.reshape(3, 2)

    //@variable A table that displays the elements of the `displayNumbers` before modification. 
    table displayTable = table.new(
         position = position.middle_center, columns = displayNumbers.columns(), rows = displayNumbers.rows(), 
         bgcolor = color.purple, border_color = color.white, border_width = 2
     )

    // Loop through the `displayNumbers`, retrieving the `rowIndex` and the current `row`. 
    for [rowIndex, row] in displayNumbers
        // Loop through the current `row` on each outer loop iteration to retrieve the `colIndex` and `element`.
        for [colIndex, element] in row
            // Initialize a table cell at the `rowIndex` row and `colIndex` column displaying the current `element`.
            displayTable.cell(column = colIndex, row = rowIndex, text = str.tostring(element), 
                 text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge
             )
            // Update the `displayNumbers` value at the `rowIndex` and `colIndex`.
            displayNumbers.set(rowIndex, colIndex, math.round(math.exp(element), 3))

    // Draw a `label` to display a "string" representation of the updated `displayNumbers` matrix. 
    label.new( 
         x = bar_index, y = 0, text = "Matrix now modified: \n" + str.tostring(displayNumbers), color = color.orange, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge, style = label.style_label_up 
     )
```

### Looping through maps

The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement is the primary, most convenient approach for iterating over the data within Pine Script [maps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/maps/).

Unlike [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/) and [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/), maps are *unordered collections* that store data in *key-value pairs*. Rather than traversing an internal lookup index, a script references the *keys* from the pairs within a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) to access its *values*. Therefore, when looping through a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map), scripts must perform *pair-wise* iteration, which entails retrieving key-value pairs across iterations rather than indexed [elements](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-arrays) or [rows](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-matrices).

Note that:

-   Although [maps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/maps/) are unordered collections, Pine Script internally tracks the *insertion order* of their key-value pairs.

One way to access the data from a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) is to use the [map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys) function, which returns an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) containing all the *keys* from the map, sorted in their insertion order. A script can use the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) structure to [loop through the array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#looping-through-arrays) of keys and call [map.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.get) to retrieve corresponding values:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for key in myMap.keys()
    value = myMap.get(key)
```

However, the more convenient, *recommended* approach is to loop through a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) directly *without* creating new [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/). To loop through a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) directly, use the [second form](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement. Using this loop with a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) creates a [tuple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#tuples) containing a *key* and respective *value* on each iteration. As when looping through a [map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys) array, this *direct* [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop iterates through a map’s contents in their insertion order:

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
for [key, value] in myMap
```

Note that:

-   The second form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is the **only** way to iterate *directly* through a map. A script cannot directly loop through this collection type without retrieving a key and value on each iteration.

Let’s consider a simple example demonstrating how a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop works on a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map). When the script below executes on the last historical bar, it declares a `simpleMap` variable to reference a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) of “string” keys and “float” values. The script uses [map.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put) to insert the keys from the `newKeys` array into the collection with corresponding values from [math.random()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random) calls. Then, it uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to iterate through the key-value pairs from the map and construct the `displayText` string. After the loop ends, the script uses a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) to visualize the string:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-maps.CZTQ1Hx7_Z1jyX7b.webp)

[Pine Script®](https://tradingview.com/pine-script-docs)

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Looping through map demo")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A map of "string" keys and "float" values to render within a `label`.
    map<string, float> simpleMap = map.new<string, float>()

    //@variable An array of "string" values representing the keys to put into the map. 
    array<string> newKeys = array.from("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
    // Put key-value pairs into the `simpleMap`. 
    for key in newKeys
        simpleMap.put(key, math.random(1, 20))

    //@variable A "string" representation of the `simpleMap` contents. Modified within a loop. 
    string displayText = "simpleMap content: \n "

    // Loop through each key-value pair within the `simpleMap`. 
    for [key, value] in simpleMap
        // Add a "string" representation of the pair to the `displayText`.
        displayText += key + ": " + str.tostring(value, "#.##") + "\n "
    
    // Draw a `label` showing the `displayText` on the current bar. 
    label.new( 
         x = bar_index, y = 0, text = displayText, color = color.green, textcolor = color.white, 
         size = size.huge, textalign = text.align_left, style = label.style_label_center
     )
```

Note that:

-   This script uses [both forms](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement. The first loop iterates through the “string” elements of the `newKeys` array to put key-value pairs into the map referenced by `simpleMap`, and the second iterates directly through the map’s key-value pairs to construct the custom string.

Notice

In contrast to [arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/) and [matrices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/matrices/), scripts **cannot** modify the sizes of [maps](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/maps/) while iterating through them with a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop. Attempting to add or remove key-value pairs to the [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) when looping through its contents typically causes a *runtime error*.

  

To correctly modify a map’s size within a loop, programmers can do any of the following:

-   Make a [copy](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/maps/#copying-a-map) of the map and loop through that copied instance.
-   Use a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to iterate through the [map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys) *array*.
-   Use a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) or [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop instead of a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop.
